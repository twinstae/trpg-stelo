  ## 플레이어 레퍼런스

  ### 기초
  
  여러분은 판타지 비행기 조종사입니다. 이 게임은 공중전을 하고 지상으로 돌아와 마시고 돈을 내는 순환을 돌며 플레이를 합니다.

  캐릭터가 무엇을 하는지 말합니다. 행동은 무브를 발동시킵니다. 그때마다 바로 해소합니다. 무브가 주사위를 굴리라고 하면, 2d10에 하나 이상의 특성치를 더해서 굴립니다.

  When you have Advantage, roll 3d10 and drop the lowest. When you have Disadvantage, drop the highest. Use a different dice colour for the extra die: if it’s a 1 on Advantage or a 10 on Disadvantage, it is a Fault.

  When you take Injury, it gives an equal penalty to all your rolls. At 3 Injury, you pass out. You can only die if you agree to.

  ### 일반 무브
  These moves can happen at any time. Many of them relate to Stress, which builds up on your character, and the binary state of Trust that exists between characters.

  #### 행운에 걸기
  *위험을 감수하면,* 그렇게 하고, 결과가 펼쳐집니다.

  #### 신뢰를 깨기
  *When you lose trust in a comrade,* erase their mark and choose one.
  - Keep your feelings hidden, and take 1 Stress.
  - Show directly and explicitly how you feel, and remove 1 Stress.

  #### 신뢰를 복구
  *When you show faith in a comrade,* mark Trust and take 1 Stress.

  #### 돕기/방해
  *When you put yourself at risk help a comrade,* give them Advantage forward. If you didn’t trust them, Restore Trust.

  *When you make a point to hinder a comrade,* give them Disadvantage forward. If you trusted them, Break Trust.

  #### 아름다움을 발견하기
  *Once per routine, when you witness beauty in the world,* describe how you are moved by what you see, and lose 1 Stress.

  #### 친밀함을 나누기
  *When you share a moment of emotional (and possibly physical) intimacy with one or more characters,* all PCs activate their Intimacy Move.

  ### 비행 점검
  Set up your Instrument Panel, and cards for your Engine, Weapon, and Radiator if you need them. Place out tokens to track your Speed, Altitude, Wet Stat line, G-Forces, RPM and Wear. Use a note or tokens to track your ammunition and fuel.

  Your aircraft has Speed and Altitude. Altitude is measured in 100s of meters; an Altitude of 12 is 1200 meters up. Speed is measured in 10s of kilometres per hour; a speed of 15 is 150 kilometres per hour. Your Speed Factor is the 10s place of your Speed; i.e. a plane at Speed 19 has a Speed Factor of 1. Your Altitude Factor works the same way.

  Your aircraft’s Structure is its Hit Points, made up of Toughness and Max Strain. When you take damage, it lowers your Toughness until it reaches 0, then it lowers Max Strain. At 0, your plane falls apart, and lower Max Strain means your plane can handle less Gs.

  Your G-Force is how much stress your plane is currently under. You take a penalty equal to your G-Force on all moves where you roll, and if your G-Force is ever greater than the 10s place of your Max Strain, your plane is in danger of falling apart.

  Your engines have an RPM gauge and a Wear gauge. RPM is how hard you are working your engines, and Wear is damage to those engines. As a rule of thumb, an RPM of 5 or above is dangerous for an undamaged engine.

  #### 컨택!
  *이륙하면,* 마스터는 “Contact!”라고 소리치고 “스위치 온!”하고 답하며, 모든 엔진을 1 RPM에 표시하고, 
  순항(cruising) 고도로 세팅하고, 속도를 편대 중에 가장 느린 비행기의 최대 속력에 맞춥니다. 적절하면 엔진 소음을 울립니다. (297페이지)

  #### 공중 정찰
  *When you lead the squadron on a search,* roll +Calm. Take +1 for each subsequent Air Patrol in a mission. This stacks for multiple uses.

  On a 16+, you find what you were looking for. On an 11-15, you find something else. On a miss, either something finds you and Engage is rolled at Disadvantage, or push Fuel Check and roll again.

  #### 장거리 비행
  *When the squadron flies a great distance,* make a clock with 1-4 segments, and roll Flat. 16+, mark 3. 11-15, mark 2. Miss, mark 1. If you’re still flying, the GM either makes a move or pushes Fuel Check.

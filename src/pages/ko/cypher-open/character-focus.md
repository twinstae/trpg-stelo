## Focus
Focus is what makes a character unique. No two PCs in a group should have the same focus. A focus gives a character benefits when they create their character and each time they ascend to the next tier. It’s the verb of the sentence “I am an adjective noun who verbs.”

This chapter contains nearly a hundred sample foci, such as Bears a Halo of Fire, Would Rather Be Reading, and Pilots Starcraft. These foci can be chosen and used as presented by a player, or by the GM who adds them to a list of available foci for their players in their next campaign.

In addition, the latter half of this chapter provides tools for the GM or an enterprising player to create their own custom foci that perfectly match the needs of a given game or campaign, as presented in Creating New Foci.


##  CHOOSING FOCI

Not all foci are appropriate for every genre. The Genre chapter provides guidance, but this section offers some broad generalizations. Obviously, the GM can include whatever foci are available in their setting. Foci end up being an important distinction in this case, because Commands Mental Powers, for example, makes it clear that psychic abilities exist in the setting, just as Howls at the Moon implies the existence of lycanthropes like werewolves, and Pilots Starcraft, of course, requires starships available to pilot.

When a focus is chosen for a character, they get a special connection to one or more of their fellow PCs, a first-tier ability, and perhaps additional starting equipment: one or two pieces of equipment that might be required for the character to use their ability, or that might pair well with the focus. For instance, a character that can build things needs a set of tools. A character that’s constantly on fire needs a set of clothes that are immune to flame. A character that draws runes to cast spells needs writing implements. A character that slays monsters with a sword needs a sword. And so on. That said, many foci don’t require additional equipment.

Each focus also offers one or more suggestions—마스터 개입—for possible effects or consequences of really good or really bad die rolls.

A couple of foci presented in this chapter provide a “type swap option” that allows a player to swap an ability that would otherwise be gained from their type for the indicated ability instead. A player doesn’t have to make the swap; they merely have the option. For instance, the focus Loves the Void provides the option to gain the ability Have Spacesuit, Will Travel instead of a type ability.

As a character progresses to a new tier, a focus grants more abilities. Each tier’s benefit is usually labeled Action or Enabler. If an ability is labeled Action, a character must take an action to use it. If an ability is labeled Enabler, it makes other actions better or gives some other benefit, but it’s not an action. An ability that allows a character to blast foes with lasers is an action. An ability that grants additional damage when an attack is made is an enabler. An enabler is used in the same turn as another action, and often as part of another action.

Each tier’s benefits are independent of and cumulative with benefits from other tiers (unless indicated otherwise). So if a first-tier ability grants +1 to Armor and a fourth-tier ability also grants +1 to Armor, when the character reaches fourth tier, a total of +2 to Armor is granted.

At tier 3 and tier 6, the character is asked to choose one ability from the two options provided.

Finally, you can choose whether you want to expand the story behind the focus (though that’s not mandatory).

## FOCUS CONNECTIONS
Choose a connection that goes well with the focus. If you’re a GM choosing (or creating) one or more foci for your players, choose up to four of the following connections. 

- 다른 PC를 한 명 고릅니다. For reasons unknown to you, that character is completely immune to your focus abilities, whether you use them for help or for harm.
- 다른 PC를 한 명 고릅니다. You knew of that character years ago, but you don’t think they knew you.
- 다른 PC를 한 명 고릅니다. You’re always trying to impress them, but you’re not sure why. 
- 다른 PC를 한 명 고릅니다. That character has a habit that annoys you, but you’re otherwise quite impressed with their abilities.
- 다른 PC를 한 명 고릅니다. That character shows potential in appreciating your particular paradigm, fighting style, or other
focus-provided attribute. You would like to train them, but you’re not necessarily qualified to teach (that’s up to you), and they might not be interested (that’s up to them).
- 다른 PC를 한 명 고릅니다. If they are within immediate range when you’re in a fight, sometimes they provide an asset, and sometimes they accidentally hinder your attack rolls (FIFTYPERCENT% chance either way, determined per fight).
- 다른 PC를 한 명 고릅니다. You once saved their life, and they clearly feel indebted to you. You wish they didn’t; it’s just part of the job.
- 다른 PC를 한 명 고릅니다. That character recently mocked you in some fashion that really hurt your feelings. How you deal with this (if at all) is up to you.
- 다른 PC를 한 명 고릅니다. That character knows you have suffered at the hands of robotic entities in the past. Whether you hate robots now is up to you, which may affect your relationship with the character if they are friendly with robots or have robotic parts.
- 다른 PC를 한 명 고릅니다. That character comes from the same place you do, and you knew each other as children.
- 다른 PC를 한 명 고릅니다. In the past, they taught you a few tricks to use in a fight.
- 다른 PC를 한 명 고릅니다. That character doesn’t seem to approve of your methods.
- 다른 PC를 한 명 고릅니다. Long ago, the two of you were on opposite sides of a fight. You won, though you “cheated” in their eyes (but from your perspective, all’s fair in a fight). They may be ready for a rematch, though that’s up to them.
- 다른 PC를 한 명 고릅니다. You are always trying
to impress that character with your skill, wit, appearance, or bravado. Perhaps they are a rival, perhaps you need their respect, or perhaps you’re romantically interested
in them.
- 다른 PC를 한 명 고릅니다. You fear that character is jealous of your abilities and worry that it might lead to problems.
- 다른 PC를 한 명 고릅니다. You accidentally caught them in a trap you set, and they had to get free on their own.
- 다른 PC를 한 명 고릅니다. You were once hired to track down someone who was close to that character.
Pick two PCs (preferably ones who are likely to get in the way of your attacks). When you miss with an attack and the GM rules that you struck someone other than your target, you hit one of these two characters.
- 다른 PC를 한 명 고릅니다. You’re not sure how or from where, but that character has a line on bottles of rare alcohol and can get them for you for half price.
- 다른 PC를 한 명 고릅니다. You recently had a possession go missing, and you’re becoming convinced that they took it. Whether or not they did is up to them.
- 다른 PC를 한 명 고릅니다. They always seem to know where you are, or at least in what direction you are in relation to them.
- 다른 PC를 한 명 고릅니다. Seeing you use your focus abilities seems to trigger an unpleasant memory in that character. That memory is up to the other PC, although they may not be able to consciously recall it.
- 다른 PC를 한 명 고릅니다. Something about them interferes with your abilities. When they stand next to you, your focus abilities cost 1 additional point.
- 다른 PC를 한 명 고릅니다. Something about them complements your abilities. When they stand next to you, the first focus ability you use in any 24-hour period costs 2 fewer points.
- 다른 PC를 한 명 고릅니다. You have known that character for a while, and they helped you gain control of your focus-related abilities.
- 다른 PC를 한 명 고릅니다. Sometime in that character’s past, they had a devastating experience while attempting something that you do as a matter of course thanks to your focus. Whether they choose to tell you about it is up to them.
- 다른 PC를 한 명 고릅니다. Their occasional clumsiness and loud behavior irritate you.
- 다른 PC를 한 명 고릅니다. In the recent past, while practicing, you accidentally hit them with an attack, wounding them badly. It is up to them to decide whether they resent or forgive you.
- 다른 PC를 한 명 고릅니다. They owe you a significant amount of money.
- 다른 PC를 한 명 고릅니다. In the recent past, while escaping a threat, you accidentally left that character to fend for themselves. They survived, but just barely. It is up to the player of that character to decide whether they resent you or have decided to forgive you.
- 다른 PC를 한 명 고릅니다. Recently, they accidentally (or perhaps intentionally) put you in a position of danger. You’re fine now, but you’re wary around them.
- 다른 PC를 한 명 고릅니다. From your perspective, they seem nervous around a specific idea, person, or situation. You would like to teach them how to be more comfortable with their fears (if they will let you).
- 다른 PC를 한 명 고릅니다. They called you a coward once.
- 다른 PC를 한 명 고릅니다. That character always recognizes you or your handiwork, whether you’re in disguise or are long gone when they arrive on the scene. 
- 다른 PC를 한 명 고릅니다. You inadvertently caused an accident that put them into a sleep so deep they didn’t wake for three days. Whether they forgive you or not is up to them.
- 다른 PC를 한 명 고릅니다. You are pretty sure you are related in some fashion.
- 다른 PC를 한 명 고릅니다. You accidentally learned something they were trying to keep a secret.
- 다른 PC를 한 명 고릅니다. They are especially sensitive to the use of your flashier focus abilities, and occasionally they become dazzled for a few rounds, which hinders their actions.
- 다른 PC를 한 명 고릅니다. They appear to have a treasured item that was once yours, but that you lost in a game of chance years ago.
- 다른 PC를 한 명 고릅니다. If it wasn’t for you, that character would have failed a past test of mental achievement.
- 다른 PC를 한 명 고릅니다. Based on a couple of comments you’ve overheard, you suspect that they don’t hold your area of training or favorite hobby in the highest regard.
Pick one other PC whose focus intertwines with yours. This odd connection affects them in some way. For example, if the character uses a weapon, your focus ability sometimes improves their attack in some fashion.
- 다른 PC를 한 명 고릅니다. They are deathly afraid of heights. You would like to teach them how to be more comfortable with their feet off the ground. They must decide whether or not to take you up on your offer.
- 다른 PC를 한 명 고릅니다. They are skeptical of your claims about something momentous that happened in your past. They might even attempt to discredit you or discover the “secret” behind your story, though that’s up to them.
- 다른 PC를 한 명 고릅니다. They have a knack for being able to recognize where your plans or schemes have a weak spot.
- 다른 PC를 한 명 고릅니다. That character’s face is so intriguing to you in a way you don’t understand that you sometimes find yourself sketching their likeness in the dirt or using some other medium you have access to.
- 다른 PC를 한 명 고릅니다. That character has an extra item of regular equipment you gave them, either something you made or an item you just wanted to give them. (They choose the item.)
- 다른 PC를 한 명 고릅니다. They commissioned you to do a job for them. You’ve already been paid but haven’t yet completed the job.
- 다른 PC를 한 명 고릅니다. You worked together in the past, and the job ended badly.
- 다른 PC를 한 명 고릅니다. While they stand next to you and use their action to concentrate on helping you, one of your focus ability’s ranges is doubled.

## STORY BEHIND THE FOCUS
The foci in this book have been purposely stripped down to basics so they have the widest possible application across multiple genres. A single descriptive sentence or two summarizes each one. After you choose a focus, you have the option to expand its presentation by adding more story and description relevant to the world or to the character.

For instance, if you choose Operates Undercover, the summarizing description is “Under the guise of someone else, you seek to find answers the powerful do not want divulged.” If you choose Conducts Weird Science, the summary is “Your preternatural insight and ability make you a scientist capable of amazing feats.” These descriptions provide what you need to know to use the focus. 

However, if you wish (and only if you wish; there is no requirement to do so), you can add more to those descriptions in a fashion that’s relevant for your game. For example, if you choose both Operates Undercover and Conducts Weird Science for use in a modern genre such as horror, urban fantasy, espionage, or something similar, you might expand the descriptions as shown in the following examples.

**Operates Undercover**: Espionage is not something you know anything about. At least, that’s what you want everyone to believe, because in truth, you’ve been trained as a spy or covert agent. You might work for a government or for yourself. You might be a police detective or a criminal. You could even be an investigative reporter.
Regardless, you learn information that others attempt to keep secret. You collect rumors and whispers, stories and hard-won evidence, and you use that knowledge to aid your own endeavors and, if appropriate, provide your employers with the information they desire. Alternatively, you might sell what you have learned to those willing to pay a premium.
You probably wear dark colors—black, charcoal grey, or midnight blue—to help blend into the shadows, unless the cover you’ve chosen requires you to look like someone else.

**Conducts Weird Science**: You could be a respected scientist, having been published in several peer-reviewed journals. Or you might be considered a crank by your contemporaries, pursuing fringe theories on what others consider to be scant evidence. Truth is, you have a particular gift for sifting the edges of what’s possible. You can find new insights and unlock odd phenomena with your experiments. Where others see a crackpot cornucopia, you sift the conspiracy theories for revelation. Whether you conduct your enquiries as a government contractor, a university researcher, a corporate scientist, or an indulger of curiosity in your own garage lab following your muse, you push the boundaries of what’s possible.
You probably care more about your work than trivialities such as your appearance, polite or proper behavior, or social norms, but then again, an eccentric like you might turn the tables on that stereotype too.

If you want to go even further, you could determine where a character’s focus abilities come from. Depending on the genre, they could derive those abilities from advanced and persistent training, via magical runes, through cybernetic parts, from their genetic heritage, or because of their access to advanced technology. For instance, a character might be able to blast targets with lightning because they got zapped by strange radiation or because they picked up a lightning gun. On the other hand, it might be because their intense training allowed them to learn lightning magic. The possibilities are nearly endless, and up to you to include or forgo. Because however a focus’s abilities were gained, it’s also enough that they just work.

## CREATING NEW FOCI
This section provides everything you need to create your own foci.
Every focus has an overarching style, whether that’s exploration, energy manipulation, or simply dealing a lot of damage in combat. These broad classifications are called focus categories.
Each focus category has an overarching theme, followed by selection guidelines that describe how to choose abilities for each tier from the Abilities chapter, from tier 1 to tier 6. 
The newly created focus should be named in the form of a verb, like Controls Beasts or Abides in Stone. For instance, a fire-using focus created by following the guidelines in the energy manipulation focus category might be called Bears a Halo of Fire (one of the sample foci in this chapter). Alternatively, a new fire-using focus should get an all-new name like Stokes the Flames of the Apocalypse or Lights Fires With a Thought.


## FOCUS CATEGORIES 
- Ally use 
- Basic 
- Energy manipulation 
- Environment manipulation 
- Exploration 
- Influence 
- Irregular 
- Movement expertise 
- Striker combat 
- Support 
- Tank combat 

 
The ability selection guidelines invite you to choose an ability from one of three ranges: low tier, mid tier, and high tier. These ranges correspond with the power “grades” given for every ability. These abilities are further sorted into ability categories based on the kinds of things they do—abilities that improve physical attacks are in the attack skill category, abilities that assist allies are in the support category, and so on. Look for the grades and categories in the Ability Categories and Relative Power section of the Abilities chapter.
Low-tier abilities are best suited for focus options at tiers 1 and 2. Mid-tier abilities are best suited for focus options at tiers 3 and 4. High-tier abilities are best suited for focus options at tiers 5 and 6.
That said, sometimes you’ll find it appropriate to assign a low-tier ability at tier 3 or 4, or maybe a mid-tier ability at tier 1 or 2. Do so sparingly, but don’t rule it out. It might be the only way to get all the abilities you want for the focus you’re building. Higher-tier abilities usually cost more Pool points to use. So if a mid-tier ability is made available at tier 1 or 2, or a high-tier ability is made available at tier 3 or 4, the higher cost will be a balancing factor.

## BALANCING ABILITIES
The guidelines within each category go a long way toward ensuring that the focus you build will be balanced. Sometimes it might be appropriate to grant a low-power ability along with a regular ability at a given tier, depending on the needs of the focus. A “low-power ability” is deliberately open for GM interpretation, but generally speaking, should be no more potent than a low-tier ability (that is, an ability that is normally available at tier 1 or 2).
For instance, someone who uses cold might be able to create small snow sculptures in addition to emitting a cold ray. Someone who uses electricity might be able to charge a depleted artifact or have an asset for dealing with electrical systems. And so on.
Often, the focus guidelines note this as a possibility. However, you have great leeway in deciding if a focus needs an additional ability, even if the guidelines for that tier don’t indicate one. If you do add an ability, or there is a
higher-power ability at a tier that normally shouldn’t have it, it might mean that the choice given at the next tier, or the previous tier, isn’t quite as good. Balancing a focus is a bit of an art. Resist the urge to overpower the focus, but don’t underpower it, either.


 
Each focus category provides a guideline for what kind of ability you should select at every tier. But don’t regard the guidelines as something that you can’t vary. They’re not prescriptive; they’re just a place to start. You might want to vary the kind of ability at a particular tier that isn’t indicated in the guidelines. As long as the chosen ability falls within the expected power curve for that tier, it’s fine. The guideline isn’t meant to be a straitjacket.

For example, if you’re building a cold-using focus for a game set in a fantasy genre, you may decide that an ability that calls up a demon is a better choice at a particular tier than an ability that does damage in an area, which is what the tier 5 guideline for energy manipulation calls for. Making the change is probably especially valid if you call your new focus something like Channels the Ninth Circle.

## ABILITY SWAP
If you’re creating a focus and you think it should provide a suite of abilities at first tier that would mechanically overload it, you have the option to add one as a “swap” ability. Doing so is as easy as allowing a character to swap out one of their type abilities for an indicated low-tier focus ability. The ability is gained instead of one of the abilities normally granted by the character’s type.

## CONCEPT AND CATEGORY

Choosing to create a focus that uses a particular concept—say, creating illusions—doesn’t lock you into creating a focus within a particular category—in this case, environment manipulation. A focus can be constructed in a variety of ways using a particular energy, tool, or concept, each ultimately leading to a focus that provides different results. It all depends on your ends. In this case, creating illusions might be used to sway others, which argues for a focus built using the influence category guidelines.

In the same way, if a focus grants a character the ability to call some kind of force or energy, that doesn’t mean the focus should automatically be built using the energy manipulation category guidelines (though of course it could, if attacking and protecting yourself with that energy is the point). But a focus could be built that grants abilities to call energy or force that is primarily focused on durability, suggesting a tank combat focus (someone who can take a lot of punishment in a fight); or blasting away with a main concern for maximizing damage, thus suggesting a striker combat focus; or creating a follower composed of that energy or force, suggesting an ally use focus (that is, someone who uses helping creatures, NPCs, or even duplicate versions of themselves to give them a leg up).

 Here’s another example: the focus Controls Gravity could conceivably be an environment manipulation focus or an energy manipulation focus. It depends on whether the focus is more concerned with crushing and holding things in place (environment manipulation) or on blasting things and protecting yourself with gravity (energy manipulation).

The same malleability of concept holds true in other realms. For instance, if someone is able to call up and mold raw earth, they might use it to transform themselves into a being of stone (tank combat), to batter foes (striker combat), or to create walls, barricades, and shields to protect their allies (support). 

If you’re looking for an ability and can’t seem to find the right one in the vast catalog in the Abilities chapter, consider reskinning one to make it seem new (and to accomplish what you need). Reskinning means that you use the underlying mechanics of an ability as written but change the flavor in some fashion. For instance, maybe you’re creating a new earth-moving focus but can’t find enough earth-related abilities to meet your need. It’s easy enough to change up other abilities so they use earth instead of fire, cold, or magnetism. For instance, Wings of Fire might become Wings of Earth, Ice Armor could become Earth Armor, and so on. These alterations change nothing except the type of damage and any knock-on effects (for instance, Wings of Earth might generate clouds of dust in their wake).

### Abilities That Reference Other Abilities
Some abilities in the Abilities chapter reference other abilities. If you select an ability for your focus or type that refers to or modifies a lower-tier ability, also include that lower-tier ability in your type or focus as a selection a PC can make at a lower tier.



## CREATING BRAND-NEW ABILITIES
You can go further than reskinning and create one or more brand-new abilities. When doing this, try to find something as close as possible to the effect you want, then use it as a template. In any case, deciding how much an ability should cost when it comes to a character’s Pool is one of the most important aspects of getting an ability right.
You may notice that higher-tier abilities are more expensive. This is partly because they do more, but it’s also because higher-tier characters have more Edge than lower-tier characters, which means they pay fewer points from their relevant Pools. A third-tier character with 3 Edge in a relevant Pool pays no cost for abilities that cost 3 or fewer points. That’s great for lower-tier abilities, but you’ll usually want a character to think a little bit about how often to use their most powerful abilities. That means they should cost at least 1 point more than the Edge the character is likely to have at that tier. (Often, a character will have an Edge in their relevant Pool equal to their tier.)
As a good rule of thumb, a typical ability should cost points equal to its tier.

### 마스터 개입을 고르기
Think about the kinds of things that might surprise, alarm, or go catastrophically wrong for someone with the new focus being created, and assign it as a 마스터 개입 for that focus. Of course, this often is done on the fly during the game. But giving the topic some thought while the focus is being constructed and the ideas are fresh in your head is likely to yield some particularly devilish options.


## FOCUS CATEGORIES

### ALLY USE
Foci that prioritize providing NPC followers to the character are ally use foci. The followers give aid to the PC in a variety of ways, but at base they usually provide an asset to the character’s actions.
Multiple potential themes exist within the ally use category, from abilities that allow a character to summon or craft allies to those that allow them to attract allies through fame, magic, or essential authority or charisma. 
Connection: Choose four relevant connections from the Focus Connections list. 
Additional Equipment: Any object necessary for the character to keep an ally. For instance, someone with a focus that uses super-science to create robot allies would require tools to build and repair those allies. Some foci in this category don’t require anything to gain or retain their benefits.
Minor Effect Suggestions: The NPC ally’s tasks are eased on its next turn.
Major Effect Suggestions: The NPC ally gains an immediate extra action.
The following are examples and not meant to provide a complete list of all possible foci in this category.
- Builds Robots
- Consorts With the Dead
- Controls Beasts
- Exists in Two Places at Once
- Leads
- Masters the Swarm
- Shepherds Spirits


#### ABILITY SELECTION GUIDELINES
- 1등급: Choose a low-tier ability that grants a level 2 NPC follower to the character, or gives a similar benefit provided by an NPC. Alternatively, lay the groundwork for gaining such NPC allies at higher tiers by choosing an ability that gives the character influence over others.
Sometimes an additional low-power ability is appropriate, depending on the focus. Often, this is an ability that grants skill training in a related area of knowledge or a related skill. For instance, training in a skill related to the kind of NPC follower the character gains would be appropriate.

- 2등급: Choose a low-tier ability that grants influence over similar kinds of NPCs as the follower gained at the previous tier. If no follower was gained at the previous tier, this ability should provide that benefit now. 
Sometimes a secondary ability might be appropriate in addition to the ability provided above, perhaps a low-power ability that grants 2 or 3 points to a Pool.

- 3등급: Choose two mid-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.
One option should be a mid-tier ability that improves the NPC follower previously provided (usually from level 2 to level 3) or grants an additional follower.
The other option should be something that benefits the character—perhaps an offensive or defensive ability, or something that broadens their influence over their followers (or potential followers).

- 4등급: Choose a mid-tier ability that gives the character an offensive or defensive capability if they haven’t previously gained one, preferably within the theme of the focus. For instance, if the character gains followers because of their charisma, this ability might let them command foes for brief periods. If the character gains followers by building or calling them, this ability might let them affect entities of the same type that are not already their followers.
Alternatively, this ability might further improve a previously gained follower from level 3 to level 4, or grant an additional follower.

- 5등급: Choose an ability that improves the character by providing a defense, an improved stat Pool, or another kind of protection.
Alternatively, this ability could open a new front in influencing and calling NPC allies related to the focus’s theme. For instance, someone who keeps beast allies might gain an ability to call a horde of lesser beasts. Someone who builds robots might gain an ability to build several lesser robot helpers. And so on.
Finally, this ability might improve a previously gained follower to level 5.

- 6등급: Choose two high-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.
One of the abilities should improve a previously gained follower to level 5, if that wasn’t already provided at tier 5. If that’s the case, this ability might be provided in addition to two other related abilities.
Another high-tier option could provide a handful of level 3 followers to the character. 
The last high-tier ability could open a new front in influencing and calling NPC allies related to the focus’s theme. For instance, someone who gains followers through high charisma and training might gain an ability to learn otherwise impossible-to-glean information.

### BASIC
Foci that rely mostly on providing skill training, assets to tasks, and bumps to stat Pools and Edge in order to improve a character fall within the basic category. An overarching theme is also included, as with most of the other categories, that makes sense of the various basic abilities provided. 
In addition, because the benefits provided by such foci are mostly straightforward (usually with a few exceptions), most basic foci would also be appropriate for non-fantastic campaigns where magic, super-science, or psychic abilities normally don’t come into play. That said, just because the abilities granted by basic foci are straightforward doesn’t mean they are not potent when combined with the abilities granted by type, descriptor, cyphers, and other character aspects.
Connection: Choose four relevant connections from the Focus Connections list.
Additional Equipment: Any object necessary to fulfill the overarching theme of the focus. For instance, a focus called Would Rather Be Reading should grant a handful of books to the character. A focus called Works for a Living should provide a set of tools.
Minor Effect Suggestions: Next action is eased.
Major Effect Suggestions: Make a free, no-action recovery roll that doesn’t count against daily recovery rolls.
The following are examples and not meant to provide a complete list of all possible foci in this category.
- Doesn’t Do Much
- Interprets the Law
- Learns Quickly
- Works for a Living
- Would Rather Be Reading

#### ABILITY SELECTION GUIDELINES
- 1등급: Choose an ability that grants training or an asset to skills associated with the focus’s theme, or that grants 5 or 6 points to a particular Pool. 
Alternatively, choose an ability that grants only 2 or 3 points to a particular Pool and an ability that provides training or an asset to just one task.

- 2등급: Choose whichever kind of ability wasn’t chosen at tier 1. 

- 3등급: Choose two mid-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.
One option should be a non-fantastic ability that improves the character’s abilities within the focus’s theme. For instance, if the theme involves paying attention in some fashion, an information-gathering ability might be appropriate.
The other option should be something that either improves the character’s Edge in an appropriate stat or provides the character with some kind of defense.

- 4등급: Choose another ability that grants additional training or an asset to skills associated with the focus’s theme, or that grants 5 or 6 points to a particular Pool best suited to the focus. Or choose two abilities that provide only 2 or 3 points plus another tier 4 ability that improves a single task or skill.
Alternatively, provide a branch-out ability suggested at tier 5.
Finally, if the focus has yet to grant some kind of defense, a defensive ability could be provided here.

- 5등급: Choose an ability that allows the character to branch out slightly—perhaps one like Expert Skill that allows them to automatically succeed on a task they’re trained in.
Alternatively, if a nonstandard benefit was provided at tier 4, provide the benefits suggested at tier 4 here.

- 6등급: Choose two high-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.
One option should be an ability that provides another 5 or 6 points to a particular Pool best suited to the focus, or that the character can divide up as they wish. Alternatively, training in offense or defense would also be appropriate.
The other tier 6 option should give the character a brand-new ability within their theme, but not one that strays into the realm of the fantastic. For instance, an ability that allows a character to take two actions instead of one would be reasonable. Granting additional training, assets, or Edge would also be fine.

### ENERGY MANIPULATION 
Energy manipulation foci offer abilities that can call fire, electricity, force, magnetism, or nonstandard forms of energy such as cold, stone, or something stranger like “void” or “shadow.” These abilities usually give a character a way to achieve something of a balance between attacking enemies and granting themselves or allies additional protection. The focus usually also offers abilities that provide other ways to use specific energy for things like transportation, creating large concentrations of energy that can affect multiple targets, or creating a temporary object or barrier of energy.
Connection: Choose four relevant connections from the Focus Connections list. 
Additional Equipment: One or more pieces of equipment immune to the energy manipulated, which might be a set of clothes. Alternatively, something related to the energy being generated. Some foci in this category don’t require additional equipment.
Energy Abilities: If a character type grants special abilities that normally use some other kind of energy, they now produce the kind used by this focus. For example, if a character uses this focus to manipulate electricity, their force blasts become blasts of electricity. These alterations change nothing except the type of damage and any knock-on effects (for instance, electricity might temporarily short out electronic systems). 
Minor Effect Suggestions: The target or something near the target is hindered because of residual energy.
Major Effect Suggestions: An important item on the target’s person is destroyed.
The following are examples and not meant to provide a complete list of all possible foci in this category.
- Absorbs Energy
- Bears a Halo of Fire
- Dances With Dark Matter
- Rides the Lightning
- Thunders
- Wears a Sheen of Ice

#### ABILITY SELECTION GUIDELINES
- 1등급: Choose a low-tier ability that either inflicts damage or provides protection using the appropriate energy type in some fashion.
Sometimes an additional low-power ability is appropriate, depending on the energy type. For instance, a focus that manipulates cold might grant an ability to create snow sculptures. A focus that manipulates electricity might grant an ability to charge a depleted artifact or have an asset for dealing with electrical systems. A focus that absorbs energy might grant an ability to release it as a basic attack. And so on.

- 2등급: Choose whichever kind of ability wasn’t chosen at tier 1. 

- 3등급: Choose two mid-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.
One option should be an ability that inflicts damage using the appropriate energy type (and possibly a related effect).
The other should grant enhanced movement by use of the appropriate energy type, give additional protection provided by the preferred energy, or use the energy in a completely new way, such as by draining the energy from a machine (if using electricity), entombing a victim in a layer of ice (if using cold), creating perfect silence (if using sound), creating a dazzling blast of illumination (if using light), and so on.

- 4등급: Choose whichever kind of ability wasn’t chosen at tier 3. 

- 5등급: Choose a high-tier ability that inflicts damage (and possibly a related effect) that can affect more than one target using the appropriate energy type, or an ability that uses the energy in some fashion not previously used, as described in tiers 3 and 6.

- 6등급: Choose two high-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.
One of the high-tier abilities should use the preferred energy to inflict a lot of damage to a single target or to several. 
The other option should use the appropriate energy type to accomplish a task not previously provided by lower-tier abilities, such as fashioning a fiery follower (if using fire), teleporting a great distance as a blast of lightning (if using electricity), creating solid objects out of the energy, and so on.

### ENVIRONMENT MANIPULATION
Foci that allow a character to move objects, affect gravity, create objects (or illusions of objects), and so on are environment manipulation foci. Given that, in many cases, energy is used as part of this process, this category and energy manipulation overlap to some extent. Environment manipulation foci prioritize abilities that indirectly affect enemies and allies via objects, forces, and alterations of the surroundings; energy manipulation foci prioritize directly damaging targets with the chosen energy or force.
For example, rather than blasting a foe with a gravity pulse that does damage, a character using an environment manipulation focus based on gravity is more likely to have abilities that hold a target in place, use gravity to throw heavy objects as an attack, or lower gravity in a particular area or even on a particular object.
Connection: Choose four relevant connections from the Focus Connections list. 
Additional Equipment: Any object necessary to manipulate the surrounding environment. For instance, someone with a focus that grants the ability to craft objects would require basic tools. Some foci in this category don’t require anything to gain or retain their benefits.
Environment Manipulation Abilities: Foci themes that involve imagery or visible energies can affect the look of your type abilities. Such alterations, if any, do nothing but change the appearance of effects. If gravity is manipulated, perhaps a telltale bluish glow permeates all ability uses, including type abilities. If illusion is generated, perhaps flamboyant visual and auditory qualities accompany type abilities, such as the appearance of a tentacled beast holding a target in place when Stasis is used. And so on.
Minor Effect Suggestions: The target gets turned around, and its next attack is hindered.
Major Effect Suggestions: The character is refreshed and recovers 4 points to one Pool.
The following are examples and not meant to provide a complete list of all possible foci in this category.
- Awakens Dreams
- Blazes With Radiance
- Calculates the Incalculable
- Controls Gravity
- Crafts Illusions
- Crafts Unique Objects
- Employs Magnetism
- Focuses Mind Over Matter


#### ABILITY SELECTION GUIDELINES
- 1등급: Choose a low-tier ability that grants a basic use of an ability that alters the environment (or predicts it) using the focus’s theme. For instance, a gravity-affecting focus might provide an ability that makes a target lighter or heavier. An
illusion-crafting focus might grant an ability that allows the creation of an image. An object-making focus might grant a basic proficiency in creating a particular kind of object. A predictive focus might calculate outcomes and provide the character with the benefits of that foreknowledge. And so on.
Sometimes an additional low-power ability is appropriate, depending on the focus. Often, this is an ability that grants skill training in a related area of knowledge.

- 2등급: Choose a low-tier ability that provides a new defensive or offensive capability related to the focus’s theme. 
Alternatively, this ability might provide an additional or brand-new capability to manipulate the environment related to the focus’s theme.

- 3등급: Choose two mid-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.
One option should be a mid-tier ability related to the focus’s theme that provides an additional environment manipulation capacity or further improves the basic environment manipulation ability previously granted. This ability isn’t directly offensive or defensive, but provides either an all-new ability related to the basic ability, or one that increases the strength, range, or some other extension of the previously unlocked basic ability.
The other mid-tier option should provide an offensive or defensive ability related to the specific form of movement the focus provides, if possible.

- 4등급: Choose a mid-tier ability that is either an offensive or a defensive use of the ability, whichever one wasn’t chosen as an option in the previous tier.

- 5등급: Choose a high-tier penultimate use of the environment-manipulation ability. For instance, if the focus-granted manipulation is illusory, this ability might haunt a target with terrifying images. If the focus is gravity based, it might unlock flight. If magnetic, it might allow the user to reshape metal. If the focus grants telekinetic powers, this ability could allow a character to hurl massive objects at foes. And so on.

- 6등급: Choose two high-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.
One of the abilities should provide either an offensive or a defensive ability, opposite the ability provided at tier 4 (though high tier rather than mid tier).
The other option should be something that further explores the use of the basic environment manipulation capability. If the tier 5 choice was the penultimate ability, this might be an even better ultimate ability related to the kind of manipulation offered, or a different way of using that ability to unlock an as-yet-unexplored facet of the ability.

### EXPLORATION
Foci that allow a character to gather information, survive in unfamiliar environments, and find their way to new locations or track down particular creatures and foes are exploration foci. Surviving in unfamiliar environments requires a reasonable selection of defensive options; however, abilities that allow a character to find and learn are prioritized. 
Exploration foci rely on a variety of methods, though training and expertise are the mainstays. Some methods require specific tools (such as a vehicle) to grant the benefits provided, while others might rely on the supernatural or
super-science to learn new things and explore strange places from afar.
Connection: Choose four relevant connections from the Focus Connections list. 
Additional Equipment: Any object necessary to explore. For instance, starting maps and/or
a compass would be basic equipment, while someone who uses psychic abilities might require a mirror or crystal sphere to gaze into. Equipment might also include access to a vehicle required for exploration, as previously noted.
Minor Effect Suggestions: You have an asset on any action that involves using your senses, such as perceiving or attacking, until the end of the next round.
Major Effect Suggestions: Your Intellect Edge increases by 1 until the end of the next round.
The following are examples and not meant to provide a complete list of all possible foci in this category.
- Explores Dark Places
- Infiltrates
- Operates Undercover
- Pilots Starcraft
- Sees Beyond
- Separates Mind From Body


#### ABILITY SELECTION GUIDELINES
- 1등급: Choose a low-tier ability that grants the character basic exploratory, survival, or information-gathering capabilities within the focus’s theme.
Sometimes an additional low-power ability is appropriate, depending on the focus. Often, this is an ability that grants skill training in a related area of knowledge or a related skill (though this may already be covered in the main ability). Alternatively, it might offer a simple bonus of 2 or 3 points to the Might Pool.

- 2등급: Choose another low-tier ability that grants an additional capability related to exploration, survival, or information gathering.
For instance, a focus dedicated to surviving savage conditions might offer an ability (or two) that makes it easier to avoid natural hazards, poisons, difficult terrain, and so on. A focus dedicated to exploration of a particular area might grant abilities to gain access to that area, or a capability that others normally lack (like the ability to see in the dark).

- 3등급: Choose two mid-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.
One option should further improve the basic exploration ability granted, or give a new exploratory, survival, or information-gathering ability.
The other option should be something that benefits the character, either an offensive or defensive ability (especially if this focus hasn’t already granted that) or something that further broadens the character’s ability to explore in the focus’s chosen realm. 

- 4등급: Choose a mid-tier offensive or defensive ability (whichever wasn’t offered at tier 3) that benefits the character. Alternatively, if offensive and defensive abilities are already well represented, choose a different mid-tier ability that broadens the character’s ability to explore, survive, or gather information.

- 5등급: Choose a high-tier ability that alleviates some of the penalties for exploring, surviving, or gathering information in a normally inhospitable place.

- 6등급: Choose two high-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.
One option should further improve the basic exploration-themed ability previously granted, or give a brand-new exploratory, survival, or information-gathering ability.
The other option should be something that benefits the character, either an offensive or defensive ability, or yet another ability that further broadens their capacity to explore in the focus’s chosen realm. 



### INFLUENCE
Foci that prioritize authority and influence—whether that’s to make people or machines do as commanded, to help others, or to rise to some other prestigious and significant position—fall within the influence category. 
These foci grant influence through training and persuasion, by direct mental manipulation, by using fame to get people’s attention and influence their actions, or simply by knowing and learning things that affect later decisions. In this sense, the concept of influence is broad.
Connection: Choose four relevant connections from the Focus Connections list. 
Additional Equipment: Any object necessary to achieve the influence suggested should be granted as additional equipment. Some influence foci don’t require anything to gain or retain their benefits.
Minor Effect Suggestions: The range or duration of the influencing ability is doubled. 
Major Effect Suggestions: An ally or indicated target can take an additional action.
The following are examples and not meant to provide a complete list of all possible foci in this category.
- Commands Mental Powers
- Conducts Weird Science
- Fuses Mind and Machine
- Is Idolized by Millions
- Solves Mysteries
- Talks to Machines
- Works the System

- 1등급: Choose a low-tier ability that allows the character to learn something significant enough that they can choose a smart course of action (or use that knowledge to persuade or intimidate). How the character learns the information varies by the specifics of the focus. One character might do experiments to learn answers, another might open a telepathic link with others to trade information secretly and quickly, and still another might simply be trained in interaction tasks.
Sometimes an additional low-power ability is appropriate, depending on the focus. Often, this is an ability that grants skill training in a related area of knowledge.

- 2등급: Choose a low-tier ability that improves the character’s ability to apply influence. This might open an additional front on the focus’s basic theme or simply further enhance the basic ability already provided. For instance, this tier 2 ability could ease influence-related tasks by a few steps, allow a telepath to read the minds of others who have secrets they’d otherwise not reveal, or grant influence over physical objects (either to improve them or to learn more about them). And so on.

- 3등급: Choose two mid-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.
One option should provide an offensive or defensive capability related to the focus’s specific kind of influence, if possible. For instance, an inventor might create a serum that gives them increased abilities (which could be used for offense or defense), a telepath might have some method of blasting foes with mental energy, and someone with only the basic skills of debate and influence through fame might have to rely on weapon training or their entourage.
The other mid-tier option should provide an additional ability to influence in the theme of the focus, or further improve the basic influence ability previously granted. This option isn’t directly offensive or defensive, but provides either an all-new ability related to the basic ability, or increases the strength, range, or some other extension of the previously unlocked basic ability. For instance, a telepath might have a psychic suggestion ability.

- 4등급: Choose a mid-tier ability that is either an offensive or a defensive use of the influence ability, whichever one wasn’t chosen as an option in the previous tier.
Alternatively, this ability could grant an additional capability related to the kind of influence the focus provides.

- 5등급: Choose a high-tier penultimate use of the specific influence ability granted at lower tiers. 
Alternatively, choose an ability not previously gained at a lower tier, one that opens a new front on the particular influence capability. For instance, if the focus-granted influence is telepathic, the tier 5 ability might allow a character to see into the future to gain assets for dealing with enemies (and allies). 

- 6등급: Choose two high-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.
One of the options should provide either an offensive or a defensive ability, opposite the ability provided at tier 4 (though high tier rather than mid tier).
The other option should be something that further explores the use of the basic influence ability provided by the focus. If the tier 5 choice was the penultimate ability, this might be an even better ultimate ability related to the kind of influence used, or a different way of using that ability to unlock an as-yet-unexplored facet of the ability.



### IRREGULAR
Most foci have a basic theme, a “character story” that logically leads to a series of related abilities. However, certain foci themes are so wide that they don’t fit into any other category except an irregular one of their own.
Irregular foci provide a basket of disparate abilities. Usually that’s because the overarching theme is one that demands variability and access to several different kinds of abilities. Often, these foci are found in genres that suggest additional rule tweaks to leverage their use even further, such as power shifts in the superhero genre and spellcasting in the fantasy genre. However, other irregular foci are possible.
Connection: Choose four relevant connections from the Focus Connections list. 
Additional Equipment: Any object necessary to the focus’s theme. For instance, a
superhero-themed focus might grant a superhero costume.
Minor Effect Suggestions: The target is also dazed for one round, during which time all of its tasks are hindered.
Major Effect Suggestions: The target is stunned and loses its next turn.
The following are examples and not meant to provide a complete list of all possible foci in this category.
- Channels Divine Blessings
- Descends From Nobility
- Emerged From the Obelisk
- Flies Faster Than a Bullet
- Masters Spells
- Speaks for the Land

#### ABILITY SELECTION GUIDELINES
- 1등급: Choose a low-tier ability that grants one of the benefits the focus theme promises, one that a first-tier character should have.
Sometimes an additional low-power ability is appropriate, depending on the focus. Often, this is an ability that grants skill training in a related area of knowledge or a related skill. Alternatively, it might offer a simple bonus of 2 or 3 points to a Pool.

- 2등급: Choose a low-tier ability that grants one of the benefits the focus theme promises, one that’s presumably not immediately related to the one provided at tier 1. That said, if a defense wasn’t provided at tier 1, tier 2 is a good place to add it.

- 3등급: Choose two mid-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.
One option should provide one of the benefits the focus theme promises, one that may not be immediately related to those provided at earlier tiers.
The other option should include a method of attack if none has previously been granted. Alternatively, if the lower-tier abilities don’t quite get the character where they need to be, this option might further increase a capability unlocked at a lower tier.

- 4등급: Choose a mid-tier ability that grants one of the benefits the focus theme promises, one that may not be immediately related to those provided at earlier tiers. 

- 5등급: Choose a high-tier ability that grants one of the benefits the focus theme promises, one that may not be immediately related to those provided at earlier tiers.

- 6등급: Choose two high-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.
One option should grant one of the benefits the focus theme promises, one that may not be immediately related to those provided at earlier tiers. However, this ability might also provide an ultimate version of a lower-tier ability if a mid-tier or low-tier option wasn’t quite sufficient.
The other option should provide an alternate method to round out the character in a way that doesn’t replicate the first tier 6 option. For instance, if the first option provided some kind of attack, this one might be an interaction, information-gathering, or healing ability, depending on the focus’s overarching theme.



### MOVEMENT EXPERTISE
Foci that prioritize novel forms of movement—in order to excel in combat, escape situations most others can’t, move with stealth for purposes of theft or escape, or move into locations normally inaccessible—fall within the movement expertise category. These foci usually have methods of granting either offense or defense through movement, though they may provide some means of doing both.
The classic movement expertise focus is one that relies on speed to make more attacks and avoid being hit, though general agility might also provide the same benefit. Other foci in this category might fall within the theme by granting a character the ability to become immaterial, to change their form into something like water or air, or to instantly move via teleportation. 
Connection: Choose four relevant connections from the Focus Connections list. 
Additional Equipment: Any object necessary to achieve great speeds, change state, or otherwise gain the benefit of the focus should be granted as additional equipment. Some foci in this category don’t require anything to gain or retain their benefits.
Minor Effect Suggestions: The target is dazed, and their next action is hindered. 
Major Effect Suggestions: The target is stunned and loses their next action.
The following are examples and not meant to provide a complete list of all possible foci in this category.
- Exists Partially Out of Phase
- Moves Like a Cat
- Moves Like the Wind
- Runs Away
- Shreds the Walls of the World
- Travels Through Time
- Works the Back Alleys

### ABILITY SELECTION GUIDELINES
- 1등급: Choose a low-tier ability that grants the basic benefit of the specific movement style, whether that’s enhanced speed, agility, immateriality, and so on.
Sometimes an additional low-power ability is appropriate, depending on the focus. If the basic benefit of the movement demands some kind of additional understanding or training, this ability could be that. Alternatively, if the movement provided seems like it should also unlock a basic offensive or defensive benefit (relying on the use of the initial basic ability), append it as well.

- 2등급: Choose a low-tier ability that provides a new offensive or defensive capability related to the focus’s theme. 
Alternatively, this ability might provide some additional capability related to the form of movement that grants useful information to the character that would normally be inaccessible to someone without the focus.

- 3등급: Choose two mid-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.
One option should provide an additional movement capacity or further improve the basic movement capacity, related to the focus’s theme. This isn’t directly offensive or defensive, but provides the character with a new level of ability or an all-new ability related to their basic movement ability.
The other option should provide either an offensive or a defensive capability related to the specific form of movement the focus provides. 

- 4등급: Choose a mid-tier ability that further enhances the advantages provided by focus’s movement-enhancing paradigm. This could provide a new or better form of defense (directly, or indirectly if moving to a location or time where danger doesn’t threaten), or a new or better form of offense.

- 5등급: Choose a high-tier penultimate use of the movement-related ability. For instance, if the focus-provided movement is temporal, this ability might allow actual (if brief) jaunts of time travel. If the focus enhances speed, this ability might allow the character to move up to a very long distance with one action. And so on.
Alternatively, unlock an as-yet-unexplored related ability that could derive from the basic movement power provided by the focus.

- 6등급: Choose two high-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.
One of the options should provide either an offensive or a defensive ability, opposite the ability provided at tier 4 (though high tier rather than mid tier).
The other option should be something that further explores the use of the basic
movement ability. If the tier 5 choice was the penultimate ability, this might be an even better ultimate ability related to the movement.

### STRIKER COMBAT
Striker combat foci prioritize dealing damage in battle over other concerns. Foci in this category offer defensive abilities as well, but they emphasize abilities that provide ways to spike damage to heights that other foci normally don’t reach.
To achieve this end, a striker combat focus might offer mastery of a particular style of martial combat, which could be training with a particular weapon or martial art, or the use of a unique tool (or even a kind of energy). A style might be something as singular as being the best at fighting a particular kind of enemy, or something much broader, such as adopting a particularly vicious or unsporting style. A striker combatant might use fire, force, or magnetism as their preferred method of spiking damage.
Connection: Choose four relevant connections from the Focus Connections list. 
Additional Equipment: The weapon, tool, or other special item or substance (if any) required to engage in the particular style of combat. For instance, a dose of level 5 poison for Fights Dirty or Murders, a trophy from a previously defeated foe for Battles Robots, or stylish clothes for Fights With Panache.
Minor Effect Suggestions: The target is so dazzled by your expertise that it is dazed for one round, hindering all of its tasks.
Major Effect Suggestions: Make an immediate additional attack using an attack provided by the focus as part of your turn.
The following are examples and not meant to provide a complete list of all possible foci in this category.
- Battles Robots
- Fights Dirty
- Fights With Panache
- Hunts
- Is Licensed to Carry
- Looks for Trouble
- Masters Weaponry
- Murders
- Needs No Weapon
- Performs Feats of Strength
- Rages
- Slays Monsters
- Throws With Deadly Accuracy
- Wields Two Weapons at
Once

#### ABILITY SELECTION GUIDELINES
- 1등급: Choose a low-tier ability that inflicts additional damage when a character attacks using the focus’s particular fighting style, energy, or attitude, or when used against a chosen enemy.
Sometimes an additional low-power ability is appropriate, depending on the focus. For instance, a focus that grants proficiency in a special weapon might offer training in crafting tasks associated with that weapon. A focus that grants increased damage against a particular kind of foe might offer training in skills to recognize, locate, or just have general knowledge about that foe. A fighting style that involves fighting in a vicious or dirty manner might provide training in intimidation. And so on.
If the focus is about fighting a particular enemy, additional secondary powers (more than might otherwise be offered) may be appropriate. Those either further enhance effectiveness against the chosen enemy, or offer broader but related abilities that give the character who takes the focus some functionality even when not fighting that enemy.

- 2등급: Choose a low-tier ability that provides some form of defense using the weapon, weapon style, or chosen energy. If the weapon style is being especially good at fighting a certain kind of foe, the ability should be a defense against that kind of foe. Alternatively, the focus might offer another method for increasing damage within the chosen paradigm.
Sometimes an additional low-power ability is appropriate at tier 2. If so, choose whichever
low-power ability wasn’t gained at tier 1.

- 3등급: Choose two mid-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.
One option should inflict additional damage when using the focus’s fighting style, energy, or attitude, or when used against a chosen enemy. That could be as simple as an ability that offers an additional attack of that kind.
The other option should provide a method to temporarily neutralize a foe by disarming them, dazing or stunning them, slowing or holding them, or otherwise discombobulating them by using the focus’s fighting style, energy, or attitude, or when used against a chosen enemy.

- 4등급: Choose a mid-tier ability that further enhances the advantages provided by the focus’s paradigm. Often, this includes training in a particular kind of attack. Alternatively, the ability might increase the advantages provided by achieving a certain combat status, such as gaining surprise.

- 5등급: Choose a high-tier ability that inflicts damage. Alternatively, if focused on fighting a particular kind of foe, this ability might give the character a chance to completely neutralize, destroy, blind, or kill a singular target of up to level 3 (or higher, if the focus is on a singular foe).

- 6등급: Choose two high-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.
One of the options should use the focus paradigm to inflict an exceptional amount of damage. 
The other option could be a different way of inflicting damage, either using the focus paradigm or just dealing lots of damage in general (and relying on previous focus tier abilities to improve targeting). This could be against multiple targets if the first option was for a single target, to outright kill or neutralize a target (starting with level 4, but with guidance for using Effort to increase the level of the target), or to select yet another foe, make another attack, or get away in order to fight another day.

### SUPPORT
Foci that allow a character to help others succeed, defend others, heal others who are hurt, and so on are support foci. Of course, most foci abilities are often used in aid of others, but support foci (such as Siphons Power) prioritize aiding, healing, and improving the character who takes the focus.
Support foci rely on a variety of methods to provide their help, including martial training used in defense, supernatural or sci-fi means of providing healing, or simply easing the cares of others through entertainment.
Connection: Choose four relevant connections from the Focus Connections list. 
Additional Equipment: Any object necessary to provide support. For instance, someone with a focus that uses entertainment to help others would require an instrument or similar object in aid of their craft. Some foci in this category don’t require anything to gain or retain their benefits.
Minor Effect Suggestions: You can draw an attack without having to use an action at any point before the end of the next round.
Major Effect Suggestions: You can take an extra action in aid of an ally.
The following are examples and not meant to provide a complete list of all possible foci in this category.
- Defends the Weak
- Entertains
- Helps Their Friends
- Metes Out Justice
- Shepherds the Community
- Siphons Power
- Works Miracles

#### ABILITY SELECTION GUIDELINES
- 1등급: Choose a low-tier ability that provides some form of defense, aid or entertainment, benefit to recovery or healing, or protection. That defense or protection could be to the PC and not to an ally, as one cannot protect another without first being able to protect themselves (and sometimes protecting themselves is the entire point).
Sometimes an additional low-power ability is appropriate, depending on the focus. Often, this is an ability that grants skill training in a related area of knowledge or a related skill, but it might be something that works with the initial ability that, by itself, wouldn’t do much.

- 2등급: Choose a low-tier ability that follows up on the support style opened in the previous tier. If the previous tier’s ability provided a means of protection only for the focus taker, this tier 2 ability should specifically provide aid to another. If the previous tier specifically provided aid to another, this tier 2 ability could defend the focus taker or provide an offensive capability grounded, if possible, in the focus’s theme.

- 3등급: Choose two mid-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.
One option should work within the focus’s theme to aid, heal, protect, or otherwise help another.
The other option should be something that benefits the character, either an offensive or defensive ability, or something that broadens their expertise in some fashion. Alternatively, it could be another, different method of helping someone else.

- 4등급: Choose a mid-tier ability that gives an ally a direct boon or provides the character with a way to help another. It could also be an ability that harms or nullifies a foe, as removing foes certainly helps allies.

- 5등급: Choose a high-tier ability that provides an offensive or defensive option for the character, if none have been provided yet. If this need has been previously addressed or is deemed unnecessary, choose a high-tier ability that provides some form of defense, aid or entertainment, benefit to recovery or healing, or protection to another. For example, a tier 5 ability might grant an ally an additional free action or allow them to repeat a failed action.

- 6등급: Choose two high-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.
One of the options should provide an ultimate method of helping another in the theme of the focus. 
The other option could provide an alternative ultimate method of helping another; many foci in this category do. However, an option that provides high-tier offense or defense is also completely reasonable.



### TANK COMBAT
Foci that prioritize being able to take a lot of punishment and soak up excess damage from foes fall within the tank combat category. These foci provide offensive abilities too, as well as additional abilities related to the particular method by which improved protection is achieved, but defensive abilities are most pronounced.
Some tank combat foci involve a physical transformation that grants additional protection, and others rely on specialized training, use tools like shields or heavy armor, or provide the ability to heal incredibly fast. The kinds of physical transformation that a tank focus provides, if any, vary widely. A focus might turn a character’s skin to stone, reinforce their body with metal, turn them into a monstrous being, make them so big it becomes harder to hurt them, and so on. 
Connection: Choose four relevant connections from the Focus Connections list. 
Additional Equipment: Any object necessary to maintain a physical transformation (such as a tool for repair if partly robotic, a shield or other defensive tool used if skilled, or possibly some kind of amulet or serum). Some tank combat foci don’t require anything to gain or retain their benefits.
Minor Effect Suggestions: +2 to Armor for a few rounds.
Major Effect Suggestions: Regain 2 points to Might Pool.
The following are examples and not meant to provide a complete list of all possible foci in this category.
- Abides in Stone
- Brandishes an Exotic
Shield
- Defends the Gate
- Fuses Flesh and Steel
- Grows to Towering Heights
- Howls at the Moon
- Lives in the Wilderness
- Masters Defense
- Never Says Die
- Stands Like a Bastion

#### ABILITY SELECTION GUIDELINES
- 1등급: Choose a low-tier ability that provides defense within the focus’s theme. If the theme is simply intense training or the use of a defensive tool, the ability might be as simple as a bonus to Armor. If protection comes from physical transformation, this ability provides the base form effects, benefits, and in some cases drawbacks for making the transformation. A low-tier enhanced healing ability would also be appropriate at first tier.
Sometimes an additional low-power ability is appropriate, depending on the focus. If the character transforms, this ability may provide a knock-on effect, though in the case of some transformations, it might be a description of how someone with an abnormal physiognomy can fully heal. Other times, the secondary power may simply be training in a related skill, or it may unlock the ability to use a particular armor or shield without penalty.

- 2등급: If the theme of the focus isn’t physical transformation, choose a low-tier ability that provides an additional method of defending, healing damage, or avoiding attacks. 
If the theme of the focus is physical transformation, choose a low-tier ability that unlocks a new capability related to the form the character takes. That might mean gaining better control of the transformation, unlocking a robotic interface, or otherwise more fully unlocking that form. This ability is not necessarily defensive, though it could be.

- 3등급: Choose two mid-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.
One option should provide an additional form of protection in keeping with the focus’s theme, such as more defensive capabilities unlocked from a transformation (which might also come with additional offensive capabilities) or a simple physical enhancement if defense is gained by skills or enhanced healing. 
The other option should provide an offensive
capability, especially if creating a non-transformation
focus that doesn’t already have offensive benefits. That capability could be an enhanced attack or provide some other benefit useful in combat, such as quickly evading or (on the other end of the continuum) becoming immovable.

- 4등급: Choose a mid-tier ability that further enhances the advantages provided by the focus’s damage-soaking paradigm. Often, this includes training in a particular kind of defense. Alternatively, it might increase the advantages provided by previously unlocked defensive abilities, whether that means gaining greater control over a transformation, gaining additional chances to avoid damage or retry tasks related to enhanced determination, and so on. If the focus is lacking in offensive options, this is a good place to include one.

- 5등급: Choose a high-tier ability that provides protection, possibly in the form of shrugging off a debilitating condition (including death). If the focus offers a physical transformation, this ability might further unlock an additional related ability, whether offensive, defensive, or something related to exploration or interaction (such as flight if the form is winged, intimidation if the form is fearsome, and so on).

- 6등급: Choose two high-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.
One option should use the focus paradigm to increase the defense, protection, or ability to shrug off damage. 
The other option could be a different way of being defensive. In some cases, the best defense is a good offense, so this option could provide a high-tier offensive ability in keeping with the focus’s theme, whether that’s a straight-up damage boost on attacks or better control of an unstable physical transformation.


## CUSTOMIZING FOCI
Sometimes not everything about a focus is right for a character’s concept, or perhaps the GM needs additional guidelines for creating a new focus. Either way, the solution lies in looking at foci abilities at their most basic default levels.
At any tier, a player can select one of the following abilities in place of the ability granted by the tier. Many of these replacement abilities, particularly at the higher tiers, might involve body modification, integration with high-tech
devices, learning powerful magic spells, uncovering forbidden secrets, or something similar appropriate to the genre.

TIER 1
Combat Prowess
Enhanced Potential

TIER 2
Lower-tier ability: choose any tier 1 replacement ability, above.
Skill With Defense
Practiced With All Weapons
Skill With Attacks

TIER 3
Lower-tier ability: choose any tier 1 or 2 replacement ability, above.
Incredible Health
Fusion Armor

TIER 4
Lower-tier ability: choose any tier 1, 2, or 3 replacement ability, above.
Poison Resistance
Built-in Weaponry

TIER 5
Lower-tier ability: choose any tier 1, 2, 3, or 4 replacement ability, above.
Adaptation
Defensive Field

TIER 6
Lower-tier ability: choose any tier 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 replacement ability, above.
Reactive Field
Abilities

This chapter presents a vast catalog of more than a thousand abilities a character can gain from their type, flavor (if any), and focus. They are sorted alphabetically by the ability’s name. 

A character’s type, flavor, and focus assign an appropriate tier to each ability. However, if you’re creating a brand-new focus or type, we provide a couple of additional tools.

The first is a power grade for each ability, which tells you about how potent it is in relation to other abilities. Abilities appropriate for tiers 1 and 2 characters are called “low-tier” abilities. Abilities appropriate for tiers 3 and 4 are called “mid-tier” abilities. Abilities appropriate for tiers 5 and 6 are called “high-tier” abilities. 

These abilities are further sorted into ability categories based on the kinds of things they do—abilities that improve physical attacks are in the attack skill category, abilities that assist allies are in the support category, and so on.

(Unless otherwise noted, you cannot choose the same ability twice, even if you get it from both your type and a flavor.)

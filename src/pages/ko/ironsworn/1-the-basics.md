## *철의 맹세*를 플레이하기
*철의 맹세* 티알피지에서, 당신은 철의 땅이라는 다크 판타지 세팅에서 위험한 임무를 맡기로 맹세한 영웅입니다. 발길이 닿지 않은 야생을 탐험하고, 필사적인 전투에서 싸우고, 고립된 공동체들과 결속을 다지며, 이 혹독한 땅의 비밀을 밝혀낼 것입니다. 가장 중요한 것은, *철의 맹세*를 하고 어떤 대가를 치르더라도 이 맹세를 이뤄내는 것입니다.

*철의 맹세*를 플레이하려면, 캐릭터를 만들고, 여러분이 사는 세상에 대해 몇 가지 결정을 하고, 이야기를 진행시킵니다. 위험하거나 불확실한 것과 조우했을 때, 당신의 선택과 주사위가 결과를 정합니다.

*철의 맹세*는 세 가지 모드의 플레이를 지원합니다.
- **안내**: 하나 이상의 플레이어들이 각자의 캐릭터, 즉 이야기의 주인공을 맡고, 게임마스터(GM)는 세션을 진행합니다. 마스터는 세상에 생기를 불어넣고, 사람들과 생물을 묘사하고, 여러분의 행동의 결과에 대해 결정을 내립니다.
- **협동 (코-옵)**: 당신과 하나 이상의 친구들이 난관을 극복하고 임무를 완수하기 위해 함께 플레이합니다. 마스터는 필수가 아닙니다. *철의 맹세*의 게임 시스템은 여러분이 캐릭터들의 극적인 이야기와 운명의 맹세를 탐험하게 도와줄 것입니다.
- **혼자**: 협동 플레이와 마찬가지로, 마스터는 필요 없습니다. 당신은 위험한 세상에서 고독한 영웅을 그리게 됩니다. 행운을 빕니다!

> *철의 맹세*는 기본적으로 혼자 혹은 작은 규모의 플레이를 의도하고 있습니다. 하나에서 네 명의 플레이어가 이상적입니다. (안내 모드에서는 마스터도 추가) 다른 캐릭터가 묘사하는 캐릭터들은 룰에서 동료로 지칭하겠습니다.

### WHAT YOU NEED
If you’re playing solo, just grab some materials and get started. A session can
be as long as you like, from a few minutes to a few hours.
If you’re playing with one or more friends—either guided or co-op—you
probably want to dedicate enough time to make some progress in your quests.
Plan on a couple of hours or more.




Make sure you have:
• Two ten-sided dice (d10) for each player. These are your challenge dice.
• One six-sided die (d6) for each player. This is your action die.
• Optionally, another pair of ten-sided dice to use as your oracle dice.
• A printed character sheet for each player and printed asset cards
(available at ironswornrpg.com).
• Some counters for marking status tracks on your character sheet. You can
use paper clips, beads, dice, coins, tokens from other games, or whatever
is convenient.
Not required, but helpful: Printed reference sheets for moves,
the blank Ironlands map, and other worksheets available at
ironswornrpg.com.
### MECHANICS AND THE FICTION
Ironsworn uses various mechanics, such as rolling dice and managing the
stats and resources on your character sheet. As a player, you will often make
decisions based on a desired mechanical outcome. For example, you might
choose a particular action to get a bonus on your die roll. The basic mechanics
of Ironsworn are introduced in this chapter.
Ironsworn is also heavily reliant on the fiction, which is the imagined
characters, situations, and places within your game. You will play from the
perspective of your character. You will interpret actions and events in a way
that is consistent with the dramatic, fictional reality you have forged for your
story and your world.
To learn more about how the mechanics and fiction interact, see page 203.

### THE SETTING
The default setting for your adventures is the Ironlands. It is a rugged
peninsula of isolated communities and untracked wilds on the frontier of the
known world. You can learn more about the setting starting on page 111. For
now, here’s a summary of some default assumptions.
• Two generations ago, your people were driven to the Ironlands from their
former homes in the Old World.
• The weather here is harsh. Winters are brutal. The rugged terrain makes
travel and trade difficult and dangerous.







• There are no thriving cities. Instead, Ironlanders live in isolated villages
or steadings. Their homes are modest buildings of wood, stone, and
thatch.
• Many areas of the Ironlands are unexplored and uninhabited except by
the firstborn—beings such as elves, giants, and the wolf-like varou.
• Coins have little value here. Most commerce is made through barter and
favors
• Some communities remain isolated and independent, while others trade
in basic goods such as iron, grain, wood, livestock, wool, and coal.
• There is a diverse mix of peoples and cultures within the Ironlands,
even within a single community. You can envision your character and
those you interact with however you like, unbound by considerations of
geography, lineage, sexual orientation, and gender.
• Communities sometimes band together under a powerful leader, but
there are no kingdoms. Territorial lines are sketchily drawn, if at all.
• Large-scale warfare is unheard of, but raiding parties and skirmishes
between communities are a constant menace. Some communities subsist
entirely on raiding.
• Spear, axe, shield, and bow are the dominant weapons. Swords are rare
and highly prized. Some warriors choose to wade into battle clad in iron,
while others trust in their prowess or in the strength of their shields.
• Magic is subtle and mysterious. Mystics seek to ward away the darkness
through the practice of magic, but often succumb to it. Rituals are
performed as blessings and to gain insight.
• Supernatural creatures and beasts are rare, frightening, and dangerous.
You are encouraged to make Ironsworn your own, and to bend the setting
to your liking. Your version of the Ironlands will be unique because you’ll
define aspects such as the history of your people, magic, mythic beasts, and
more. The choices you make will help inspire the personal vows driving your
character.
You can also ignore the Ironlands entirely and play in your own world, or
explore a setting inspired by media, history, or another roleplaying game. The
Ironsworn rules are flexible enough to accommodate many forms of gritty
fantasy or historical fiction.
With a bit of work, you can even adapt these rules to different genres. See page
237 for more on hacking Ironsworn.




### IRON VOWS
In the Ironlands, a vow is sacred. When you declare your solemn promise to
serve or aid someone, or to complete a personal quest, your honor is bound to
that vow. Abandoning or recanting an oath is the worst sort of failure.
When you swear a vow, you touch a piece of iron. It can be an iron coin, a
weapon, or your armor. It’s an old tradition. Some say the iron, a piece of the
primal world, serves as a conduit to the old gods—so they may better hear
your promise.
Vows are the core of playing Ironsworn. It is your vows that drive you. These
goals create the context for your adventures and challenges. As you complete
vows, you gain experience and new abilities.
When you create your character, you start with a background vow. When you
setup your campaign, you envision or encounter an inciting incident which
triggers a new vow. There are several prompts for vows associated with the
details of the world in chapter 4 (page 111), and with foes and encounters in
chapter 5 (page 133). You can select something which fits your vision for the
world and your character’s goals, or just come up with something yourself. If
you are playing in co-op mode, you and your fellow players may have shared
vows and personal vows.
To learn more about your first vows and starting your campaign, see page
193.
### YOUR CHARACTER
You use your character sheet to track your stats, overall condition, and
progress in your quests. You also have assets (page 21), which are abilities
you choose when you create your character and when you gain experience.
These components help you determine the outcome when things get
dangerous or uncertain.
However, your character is more than these mechanical bits. You are the
protagonist in a rich story. You have hopes and fears, virtues and failings. You
have a history. You are, or were, part of a community. This is the fiction of
your character. Consider a few of these details as you create your character,
but don’t sweat it. You’ll evolve it through play. At the start of your game,
put your character on stage to see what happens. Fill in the blanks—for your
character and your world—as you go.
To learn more about creating your character and the components that make
up your character, see page 31.

BONDS
As you fulfill
vows, you earn
experience (page
44). You spend
experience to gain
new assets.
You have five stats (page
33) which represent
the core aspects of your
character. These are
often added as a bonus
when you take action.
You have status
tracks for health,
spirit, and supply
(page 33).
These represent
your current
condition and
readiness.
As you take action, you
build or lose momentum
(page 11). Positive
momentum can help
improve the result of
an action. Negative
momentum can undermine
an otherwise successful
action.
Your vows (page 35)
are your sacred oaths to
complete perilous quests.
Each vow has a rank and
is managed through a
progress track.
You suffer debilities
(page 36) as you
face harrowing
challenges. Some
debilities are
temporary and easily
mended; others are
permanent.




## MOVES
Moves are self-contained systems to resolve a specific action, scene or
question. There is a move for most common situations you encounter in
Ironsworn. They have specific triggers, phrased as “When you [blank].” When
your character does that thing, or you encounter that situation, refer to the
move to see what happens.
Moves are organized by activities.
• Adventure moves (page 60) cover a variety of dangers, conducting
investigations, traveling, making camp, and healing.
• Relationship moves (page 69) involve persuading others to do
something, building bonds with people and communities, resting and
recuperating within a community, aiding your allies, and initiating duels.
• Combat moves (page 78) are used when fighting (but not exclusively;
other moves may come into play as well).
• Suffer moves (page 90) occur when you endure hardship, such as
suffering physical harm or facing a dispiriting challenge.
• Quest moves (page 98) encompass iron vows, making progress in a
sworn quest, and improving your character.
• Fate moves (page 104) help you decide what happens in solo and co-op
play, or support the GM’s decisions and brainstorming in guided play.
When a move’s name is referenced within these rules or by another move,
you’ll see it as italicized text.
Most moves are based on risky actions you are taking. You are attacking with
your sword, making a dangerous climb, or healing an ally. These moves use
dice to determine the outcome. This is called an action roll (page 8).
Some moves measure your headway against an extended challenge, such as a
journey or fight, using a progress track (page 14). When you are ready to
resolve the challenge, you make a progress roll (page 18).
Other moves utilize a different kind of dice roll, called an oracle roll (page
22). These moves help determine the outcome of uncertain events out of
your character’s control. If you’re playing solo or co-op, you can use the Ask
the Oracle move (page 107) to answer questions about the world, resolve how
other characters respond, or determine what happens next.
Some moves don’t require a roll. They might support or reference a separate
move, or simply help you resolve a mechanical or narrative situation. Don’t
roll dice unless a move tells you to. To learn more about moves, see page 49.







GATHER INFORMATION
When you search an area, ask questions,
conduct an investigation, or follow
a track, roll +wits. If you act within a
community or ask questions of a person
with whom you share a bond, add +1.
On a strong hit, you discover something
helpful and specific. The path you must
follow or action you must take to make
progress is made clear. Envision what you
learn (Ask the Oracle if unsure), and take +2
momentum.
On a weak hit, the information complicates
your quest or introduces a new danger.
Envision what you discover (Ask the Oracle
if unsure), and take +1 momentum.
On a miss, your investigation unearths a
dire threat or reveals an unwelcome truth
that undermines your quest. Pay the Price.
This is the move’s trigger.
When you do this
thing, or encounter this
situation, make the move.
Moves with an action roll
include three levels of
possible results: A strong
hit, a weak hit, and a miss.
When a move is
referenced within
another move, you’ll
see it as italicized text.
Moves which require an
action roll will tell you
which stat to add to your
roll, and may give you an
option to include other
bonuses (called adds).
This is the
move’s name.




## THE ACTION ROLL
When you make a move representing a risky or uncertain action, you roll
three dice at once.
• Challenge dice: Two ten-sided dice (D10)
• Action die: A six-sided die (D6)
3
4 8
CHALLENGE DICE ACTION DIE
Add your relevant stat to your action die. The move will tell you which stat to
add, or may give you a choice. Some moves will tell you to use one of your
tracks, such as health or supply, in place of a stat. Based on the move or your
character’s assets, you may also have an opportunity to apply one or more
bonuses called adds. The total of your action die, your stat, and any adds is
your action score. Your action score is never greater than 10—anything over
that is ignored.
To determine the outcome of your move, compare the action score to each
of the challenge dice. You want it to be greater than the individual value of
those dice.

Greater than NOT greater than







There are three possible results for a move.
Strong Hit
Your action score is
greater than both the
challenge dice. You
succeed at what you
are trying to do.
Weak Hit
Your action score
is greater than only
one of the challenge
dice. You probably
succeeded, but with a
lesser effect or cost.
Miss
Your action score isn’t
greater than either
of the challenge dice.
You failed, or need to
make some serious
concessions.
The move will tell you how to interpret the outcome of your action, or offer a
choice. The result may include mechanical changes to your character’s status
and narrative changes to the current situation.
When you score a miss on a move, you’ll usually see a prompt to Pay the Price.
This is a special move that lets you pick a likely negative outcome or roll to see
what happens. If you’re playing with a GM, they may consult with this move,
or just tell you the price.
The main thing to remember on a miss: Something always happens. The
situation gets more complex, dramatic, or dangerous. To learn more about
the Pay the Price move, see page 105.
> Ties always go to the challenge dice. Your action score needs to exceed—not equal—the challenge dice to count as a hit.

### MATCHES
5 = 5

When you roll for a move, you
should be on the lookout for a
match on the challenge dice. In
cooperative and solo play, this is
your trigger to add a twist, create
a new complication, or otherwise mix things up. Something interesting,
unexpected, or unusual happens. If you’re unsure, you Ask the Oracle, which
is a move you use to ask questions or check for inspiration. If you’re playing
with a GM, a match on the challenge dice can be their prompt to introduce a
surprising turn of events.




The outcome of a match should be evaluated based on the result of your move.
• Strong hit: The match should represent a twist in the narrative, something
interesting, or a new opportunity.
• Miss: The match should represent a heightened negative outcome, a
complication, or new danger. Things get worse for you in an unexpected
way.
You can also let the intensity of your success or failure frame how you interpret
a match. Rolling matched 10’s on your challenge dice should prompt you to
introduce a harrowing turn of events or a dire failure. It’s as bad as things get.
### GM’S AND THE DICE
If you are playing as a GM, you can focus on guiding the game and responding
to your player’s questions and actions. Since NPCs don’t make moves, you
won’t need to make action rolls. However, you might want to have a pair of
D10’s available for oracle rolls (page 22).







## MOMENTUM
Momentum is a special mechanic which is central to playing Ironsworn. Your
momentum value ranges from a -6 to +10 and represents how you are faring
in your quests. Move results may tell you to increase or decrease momentum.
The momentum track is on the left side of your character sheet. You can use
a paper clip or token to mark the current value.
When you have positive momentum, things are going your way. You have the
advantage. You are in control. Your path is clear. You are properly positioned
for success.
When you have negative momentum, the tide has turned against you. You
face tough odds. You are outmatched. Your next steps are uncertain.
Momentum persists through scenes and between gaming sessions.
When you finish a session, write down your current momentum
value. Then, pick up where you left off when you return to the game.
### GAINING MOMENTUM
You gain momentum as an outcome or option when making moves. This
represents securing advantages, acquiring new insight, and making progress
in your quests. If a move tells you to add momentum (phrased as “take +X
momentum”), increase your momentum track by the value indicated. The
choices you make in a move, or the assets you use to support the move, may
modify the amount rewarded.
In general, taking +1 momentum represents a minor advantage. Taking +2
momentum (or more) represents a major advantage.
### LOSING MOMENTUM
You can lose momentum as a choice when making moves, or as an outcome
of a move—particularly on a weak hit or miss. If a move tells you to suffer a
specific loss of momentum (phrased as “suffer -X momentum”), you reduce
your momentum track by the value indicated. The options you choose in a
move, or the assets you leverage, may alter this penalty.




If you lose momentum as a result of a narrative outcome without a defined
value, such as when you make the Pay the Price move (page 105), you should
suffer a reduction appropriate to the narrative circumstances.
• For a minor disadvantage or complication, suffer -1 momentum.
• For a major disadvantage or complication, suffer -2 momentum.
Some moves and assets give you the option to suffer a loss of momentum
in exchange for temporary advantages. If you take this option, adjust your
momentum track by the amount indicated.
### BURNING MOMENTUM
Burning momentum is a powerful option to build on your success and deliver
a decisive result or avoid dire failure. When you have positive momentum,
after you roll your move, you may cancel any challenge dice that are less than
your current momentum value. This gives you an automatic hit.
If both challenge dice are less than your momentum value, you may cancel
them both for a strong hit. If you burn momentum when only one of the
challenge dice is less than your momentum value, the result of the other die
stands—giving you a weak hit.
For example, your momentum track is at +6 and your action score is 4. You
roll a 5 and an 8 on your challenge dice. You may burn momentum to cancel
the 5, but not the 8. This shifts your result from a miss to a weak hit.

MOMENTUM TRACK
Burning momentum is never required. Even if you score a miss on a move
and have enough momentum to cancel the challenge dice, you can choose to
suffer the failure and save your momentum for a more crucial moment.
After you burn momentum, you must reset your momentum. See the next
page for how that works.
You may cancel
this die.







### RESETTING MOMENTUM
After you burn momentum, you must adjust your momentum track to your
momentum reset value. The default reset is +2. This value may be lowered
when your character suffers from a debility (page 36). Debilities are
conditions such as wounded, shaken, or unprepared. They are marked on
your character sheet as a result of a move or a narrative event.
• If you have one debility marked, your momentum reset is +1.
• If you have more than one debility marked, your momentum reset is 0.
There is a box below the momentum track where you can record your current
momentum reset.
### SUFFERING NEGATIVE MOMENTUM
When your momentum is less than 0, and it matches the value of your action
die, you must cancel your action die. You still check the success of your move
by comparing your stat plus your adds to the challenge dice, but you won’t
have your action die to help you.

### MINIMUM MOMENTUM
Your momentum cannot drop lower than -6. This is your minimum
momentum. If a move tells you to lower your momentum, and your
momentum is already at its minimum, you will instead make the Face a
Setback move (page 97). As a result of this move, you reduce your health,
spirit, or supply (or some combination thereof) by that amount, or undermine
your progress in a current quest, journey, or fight.
Make moves such as Secure an Advantage (page 61) to increase your
momentum.
You must cancel
this die.




### MAX MOMENTUM
Your max momentum starts at +10, and is reduced by 1 for every marked
debility. There’s a spot on your character sheet to record this value. You can’t
increase momentum over your max. If you are at your max and a move gives
you an option to increase your momentum, you can’t take that benefit.
## PROGRESS TRACKS
A progress track is used to measure your pace and determine the outcome of
a goal or challenge in specific situations.
• When you Swear an Iron Vow (page 98), a progress track represents
the challenges you overcome on your way to achieving your ultimate goal.
• When you Undertake a Journey (page 65), a progress track represents
how far you’ve gone and how favorable the travel has been.
• When you Enter the Fray (page 78), a progress track represents your
advantage as you weaken or wound your foes in combat.
• When you establish a new relationship with a character in your world
and Forge a Bond (page 74), you mark your bond on a progress track.
Progress tracks are drawn as a row of ten boxes which you fill in—or mark—
as you make headway toward a goal. When you initiate a challenge, these
boxes are empty.
Since making progress on your quests may stretch over many sessions, your
character sheet includes progress tracks for vows. Your character sheet also
includes a progress track for your bonds. For journeys and fights, you can
sketch out your progress tracks on whatever is convenient, or use the challenge
worksheets provided at ironswornrpg.com.
### CHALLENGE RANKS
When you engage in a fight, initiate a journey, or swear a vow, you give your
challenge a rank. In increasing order of difficulty, the ranks are troublesome,
dangerous, formidable, extreme, and epic. You (or the GM) will choose
a rank appropriate to the situation and how quickly or easily it should be
resolved. Troublesome is used for simple challenges. A typical challenge is
dangerous or formidable. Epic and extreme challenges require great effort and
luck to overcome. Guidelines for foes are on page 134, and for journeys on







page 111. Give your vows a rank appropriate to the complexity of your quest
and the amount of emphasis you want to give the vow in your story.
### MARKING PROGRESS
You will perform specific moves to advance toward your goal. For example, as
you travel across perilous lands, you Undertake a Journey and mark progress
when you successfully reach waypoints in your travel.
UNDERTAKE A JOURNEY
When you travel across hazardous or unfamiliar
lands, first determine the rank of your journey (Ask the
Oracle if unsure).
• Troublesome journey: 3 progress per waypoint.
• Dangerous journey: 2 progress per waypoint.
• Formidable journey: 1 progress per waypoint.
• Extreme journey: 2 ticks per waypoint.
• Epic journey: 1 tick per waypoint.
Then, for each segment of your journey, roll +wits. If
you are setting off from a community with which you
share a bond, add +1 to your initial roll.
On a strong hit, you reach a waypoint. If the waypoint
is unknown to you, envision it (Ask the Oracle if
unsure). Then, choose one.
• You make good use of your resources: Mark
progress.
• You move at speed: Mark progress and take +1
momentum, but suffer -1 supply.
On a weak hit, you reach a waypoint and mark
progress, but suffer -1 supply.
On a miss, you are waylaid by a perilous event. Pay the
Price.
This move
lets you mark
progress on
a strong or
weak hit.
Similarly, when you fight, you Strike (page 79) or Clash (page 80) to
inflict harm on your foe. To move forward in your quest, you use the Reach
a Milestone move (page 100). These incremental moves let you amass
advantages to have the best chance of success when you are ready to resolve
your challenge.




Whenever you successfully move toward your goal, you partially or fully fill
in a box on your progress track. You fill progress boxes with lines—called
ticks. A full progress box consists of four ticks in a star-shaped pattern. When
a move tells you to mark progress, fill in the appropriate number of ticks or
progress boxes based on the rank of your challenge.
Troublesome
mark 3
progress
Dangerous
mark 2
progress
Epic
mark 1
tick
Formidable
mark 1

Extreme

MARKING PROGRESS FOR BONDS
If you are marking progress on your bonds progress track, you always mark 1
tick unless a move tells you otherwise. Bonds are not given a challenge rank.
To learn more about bonds, see page 24.







### PROGRESS MOVES
There are four moves, called progress moves, which utilize progress tracks to
resolve the outcome of a goal or challenge.
• To resolve a quest, Fulfill Your Vow (page 101).
• To end your journey, Reach Your Destination (page 68).
• To decide the outcome of combat, End the Fight (page 82).
• When you retire from your life as Ironsworn, Write Your Epilogue (page
77).
REACH YOUR DESTINATION
Progress Move
When your journey comes to an end, roll the
challenge dice and compare to your progress.
Momentum is ignored on this roll.
On a strong hit, the situation at your
destination favors you. Choose one.
• Make another move now and add +1.
• Take +1 momentum.
On a weak hit, you arrive but face an
unforeseen hazard or complication. Envision
what you find (Ask the Oracle if unsure).
On a miss, you have gone hopelessly astray,
your objective is lost to you, or you were
misled about your destination. If your journey
continues, clear all but one filled progress, and
raise the journey’s rank by one (if not already
epic).
This label identifies
this move as a
progress move.
A progress move
uses a progress
roll instead of an
action roll (see
the next page for
how it works).




### PROGRESS ROLLS
You don’t make an action roll when you make a progress move. Instead, you
tally the number of fully filled progress boxes (those with four ticks). This
is your progress score. Then, roll your challenge dice and compare your
progress score to the value of the dice.
As with an action roll, if your progress score is greater than both challenge
dice, it’s a strong hit. If you beat one of the challenge dice, it’s a weak hit. If you
fail to beat either die, it’s a miss. The progress move will tell you how to resolve
the challenge based on the outcome of your roll. Also, keep an eye out for a
match, which represents a surprising twist or unusual complication.
In the example below, you would compare your +6 progress score to your
challenge dice when making your progress move. The seventh progress box is
only partially filled in, and won’t count toward the progress score.
PROGRESS SCORE 6
4 6
CHALLENGE DICE
When deciding whether to make your progress move, you need to weigh your
chance of success against the risk of continuing to make preparatory moves.
One thing to remember: It’s not necessary to fill your progress track before
making your progress move. In fact, a weak hit or miss on a progress roll can
lead to exciting new story possibilities.
MOMENTUM AND PROGRESS ROLLS
Momentum is ignored when you make a progress move. You cannot burn
momentum on a progress roll, and you do not suffer from negative momentum.
### SHARING PROGRESS TRACKS WITH ALLIES
When you and your allies are working together to resolve a challenge—a
quest, a journey, or a fight—you share a progress track and mark progress
together. When you make a progress move, only one of you rolls the dice. The
result will stand for the group.







## HARM
Harm represents physical damage and fatigue. You inflict harm on your foes
in combat, and you Endure Harm when you are attacked or fail to overcome a
physical hazard or ordeal.
### INFLICTING HARM
When you successfully attack a foe using the Strike (page 79) or Clash (page
80) moves, you inflict harm. If you are armed with a deadly weapon (such
as a sword, axe, spear, or bow), you inflict 2 harm. If you are unarmed or using
an improvised or simple weapon (such as a shield, stick, club, staff, or rock),
you inflict 1 harm. You may have an option to inflict additional harm through
the choices you make in a move.
Each point of harm you inflict is marked as progress on your foe’s progress
track, as appropriate to their rank. For example, each point of harm equals 2
ticks when fighting an extreme enemy, or 2 full progress boxes when fighting
a dangerous enemy.
### ENDURING HARM
When you face physical injury or hardship, make the Endure Harm move
(page 91). As part of that move, you reduce your health track by the amount
of harm suffered. There are five ranks of harm.
• Troublesome (1 harm): An attack by a minor foe, a painful injury, or a
tiring effort.
• Dangerous (2 harm): An attack by a skilled foe or deadly creature, a
nasty injury, or a demanding effort.
• Formidable (3 harm): An attack by an exceptional foe or mighty creature,
a serious injury, or an exhausting effort.
• Extreme (4 harm): An overwhelming attack by a monster or beast, a
grievous injury, or a debilitating effort.
• Epic (5 harm): An attack by a legendary foe of mythic power, a horrific
injury, or a consuming effort.
When you are fighting a foe, they inflict harm based on their rank. Sample
foes are in chapter 5 (page 133).
If you are at 0 health, a miss on the Endure Harm move puts you at risk
of suffering a debility or dying. You can recover health through rest and
recuperation, using moves such as Heal (page 63), Make Camp (page 64),
and Sojourn (page 71).




## STRESS
Stress represents mental burdens and trauma. When you face mental shock
or despair, make the Endure Stress move (page 95). As part of that move,
you reduce your spirit track by the amount of stress suffered. There are five
ranks of stress.
• Troublesome (1 stress): An unsettling incident or frustrating failure.
• Dangerous (2 stress): A distressing incident or upsetting failure.
• Formidable (3 stress): A horrifying incident or demoralizing failure.
• Extreme (4 stress): A heart-rending incident or traumatic failure.
• Epic (5 stress): A soul-shattering incident or the loss of all hope.
When you are opposing a foe, they can inflict stress (such as a terrifying
visage or demoralizing taunt) based on their rank. Sample foes are in chapter
5 (page 133).
When you Endure Stress, you reduce
your spirit track by the amount of
stress suffered. If you are at 0
spirit, you are in danger of
suffering a debility or falling
into desolation.
You can recover spirit by
relaxing when you Make
Camp (page 64), finding
fellowship when you
Sojourn (page 71), or
when you Forge a Bond
(page 74).
Unlike harm, you do not
inflict stress on others—at
least not mechanically. If you
attempt to frighten or demoralize
another character, make an
appropriate move to see what
happens.







## ASSETS
Assets are a key component of your character. They give you additional
options and bonuses when making a move, and may include their own special
moves. When you create your character (page 31), you select your starting
assets. When you Fulfill Your Vow and gain experience (page 44), you can
Advance to spend your experience on new assets or upgrade current assets.
To learn more about assets, see page 39.
You can mix-and-match assets however you like. There are no
designated assets based on character classes or roles. However, you
should avoid picking the same asset as another player.
PATH
SLAYER
 When you Gather Information by
tracking a beast or horror, or when
you Secure an Advantage by readying
yourself for a fight against them, add
+1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.
{ When you Swear an Iron Vow to slay
a beast or horror, you may reroll any
dice. When you Fulfill Your Vow and
mark experience, take +1 experience.
{ When you slay a beast or horror (at
least formidable), you may take a
trophy and choose one.
• Power a ritual: When you or an ally
make a ritual move, reroll any dice
(one time only).
• Prove your worth: When you Sojourn,
reroll any dice (one time only).
This is the asset type. When you pick
an asset, you choose from companions,
paths, combat talents, and rituals.
Most assets include a
default ability, represented
by the filled-in circle. If
it doesn’t have a starting
ability, you get to pick one.
As you gain
experience, you can
purchase upgrades for
your assets. When you
purchase an upgrade,
you fill in the circle
to show that you now
have that ability.
Assets usually modify
moves by giving you
a bonus or allow you
to use the move in a
different way. Some
assets include their
own unique moves.




## ORACLES
Some moves may prompt you to roll on a table to generate a result between
1 and 100. There are also a set of creative prompts in chapter 6 (page 165),
which you can use to reveal details, trigger events, and guide the actions of
other characters in your world. These oracles help answer questions in solo or
co-op games, or provide inspiration for the GM in guided play.
### ROLLING ORACLE DICE
Whenever you are prompted by a move or an oracle table to generate a result
between 1 and 100, roll two ten-sided dice.
3 6
One of your oracle dice may
include tens digits on its faces. If
so, you’d read this result as 83.
You can also use two D10s of
different colors, and decide
before rolling which represents
the tens digit and which is the
units. You’d read this result as 36.
80 3
You might want to use a special set of dice for your oracle rolls,
shared by everyone at the table. It’ll make those dice feel special and
unique.







### SEEKING ANSWERS
If you are playing solo or co-op, you can Ask the Oracle to help guide your
game session and trigger ideas when you need to know what happens next.
Its most basic function is to answer a “yes” or “no” question. Combined with
your own instincts and creativity, this move—and other random prompts—
can push your story in surprising and exciting directions. To learn more about
this move, see page 107.
If you are playing with a GM, they are the oracle. When you see a prompt to
Ask the Oracle, turn to your GM. The GM is free to leverage random tools and
creative prompts to come up with the answers.
Keep in mind that—even when playing with a GM—Ironsworn is about
shared storytelling. Offer suggestions. Talk it out. The GM is the final arbiter
of what happens next, but everyone at the table should participate in building
the world and creating the narrative of your game.
ASK THE ORACLE
When you seek to resolve questions, discover
details in the world, determine how other
characters respond, or trigger encounters or events,
you may…
• Draw a conclusion: Decide the answer based on
the most interesting and obvious result.
• Ask a yes/no question: Decide the odds of a
‘yes’, and roll on the table below to check the
answer.
• Pick two: Envision two options. Rate one as
‘likely’, and roll on the table below to see if it is
true. If not, it is the other.
• Spark an idea: Brainstorm or use a random
prompt.
Odds
The answer is ‘yes’
if you roll...
Almost Certain 11 or greater
Likely 26 or greater
50/50 51 or greater
Unlikely 76 or greater
Small Chance 91 or greater
On a match, an extreme result or twist has occurred.
Roll on this
table using
your oracle dice
to generate a
result between
1 and 100




### MORE RANDOMNESS
You’ll find a set of random tables in chapter 6 (page 165). These provide
inspirational prompts and random results for common situations. You can
also use whatever random generators you prefer, including those drawn from
another game, online generators, or visual tools such as tarot cards.
### TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS
These random generators will never replace your own imagination and
intuition. If it’s interesting, dramatic, and pushes the story forward, make it
happen. Too much reliance on random generators to answer questions about
“what happens next” can kill the momentum of your game or make it feel
disconnected and incoherent.
Keep it moving. Ask a question. If an answer leaps to mind, go with it. If you’re
not sure, Ask the Oracle. Then, play.
## BONDS
As you explore your world and complete quests, you create bonds with people
and communities by making the Forge a Bond move (page 74). Bonds give
you advantages for specific moves when interacting with those you have
bonded with. For example, if you attempt to Compel someone (page 69),
and you share a bond with them, you add +1 to your action score. The moves
tell you when having a bond provides this advantage.
Bonds also help determine your fate when you retire from your life as an
adventurer. The more bonds you create, the more connections you have
with people and communities, the better your chance to live out your days
peacefully in the company of others.
Your character sheet has a special progress track for bonds. When you
successfully Forge a Bond, mark 1 tick on this progress track. When your
adventures are complete and you Write Your Epilogue (page 77), tally your
bonds and make a progress roll (page 18) to wrap up your character’s story.
## OTHER CHARACTERS
The mechanics of Ironsworn are almost entirely character-facing—meaning
they reference the capabilities and actions of your character. Other non-player
characters and creatures (NPCs) don’t have mechanical detail. In fact, they
may only have a single stat—their rank—for tracking progress against them
in a combat scene. Further, NPCs do not make moves. You won’t roll dice
for them to determine the outcome of their actions. When you attempt to







influence them, oppose them, resist them, or aid them, make moves as your
character. If you have questions about an NPC’s motivations or what they do
next, Ask the Oracle. To learn more, see page 133.
### ALLIES AND COMPANIONS
If you are playing a co-op or guided game with other players, their characters
are referred to in these rules and in moves as your allies.
A companion is a special type of asset. Unlike normal NPCs, they can
provide mechanical benefits through their abilities, and they have a health
track to record harm. If the text of a move refers to a companion, it means a
companion asset. To learn more about companions, see page 39.
## EQUIPMENT
In Ironsworn, you won’t worry too much about equipment. Your supply track
(page 34) is an abstract representation of your general readiness, clothes,
ammo, food, water, and mundane gear.
You are armed and armored as appropriate to your vision for your character.
If you wield a weapon, you can inflict harm with it. If you are armed with a
deadly weapon (such as a sword, axe, spear, or bow), you inflict 2 harm. If you
are unarmed or using an improvised or simple weapon (such as a shield, stick,
club, staff, or rock), you inflict 1 harm.
Other equipment provides narrative benefit. It enables you to make moves
where that gear is important, or perhaps allows you to avoid a move altogether.

> For example, you need to make your way down a steep rock face. Without assistance, you’d make a Face Danger move to see what happens. If you had rope, the climb is not particularly risky or uncertain. In that case, you might skip the move and just narrate the result.

Specific assets (page 39) can make equipment more important and relevant
to your character. For example, combat talent assets (page 40) represent
your expertise in a particular weapon or fighting style. When you wield an
appropriate weapon, you gain the benefit of the asset.
Apart from assets, you can make note of equipment at whatever level of
detail you like, but don’t fuss over it. If you’re wondering whether you have a
particular mundane item, you can Ask the Oracle (page 107).




## THE FLOW OF PLAY
Like most roleplaying games, you play primarily from the perspective of your character. What are you doing? What are you trying to achieve? What opposition and challenges do you face? Your quests, and the characters and situations you encounter, will guide the fiction and the choices you make.


When you have questions about what you find, how other characters in your world respond, or what happens next, you can go with what feels right (if you’re playing solo or co-op), or ask your GM. When you are seeking inspiration or want to put it in the hands of fate, you make the Ask the Oracle move (page 107). Use the yes/no questions and random prompts to generate interesting twists and new complications you might not have thought of on your own. Above all, if it’s interesting, dramatic and fits the fiction, make it happen.


If you are doing something covered by a move, refer to the move to resolve your action. If it tells you to roll dice, do it.


Scoring a strong hit on a move means you are in control. You’re driving the narrative. What do you do next?


A weak hit or a miss means you don’t have control of the situation. Instead of acting, you react. What happens next? If you’re playing with a GM, they’ll determine how the world responds. Otherwise, you rely on your intuition and occasional oracle rolls to drive the narrative.

## WHAT’S NEXT
That’s the basics of playing Ironsworn. You’ll see these concepts referenced
and expanded throughout this rulebook, but it’s not necessary to read or
understand it all before playing. To get started:

1. **Create your character (page 31).** Set your stats, select your
assets, and consider your background and personality.
1. **Build your world (page 111).** Take a tour of the Ironlands, create
your unique vision of the setting, and find inspirational prompts
for vows and quests. Or, start playing in your own world.
1. **Review the moves (page 49).** It’ll be helpful to get a basic
understanding of the moves and how you resolve your character’s
actions and intent. You can start by printing out the move reference
sheets, available at ironswornrpg.com. Then, refer to chapter 3
when you have a question or want further detail.
1. **Review the example of play (page 241).** See Ironsworn in action
to help understand the basic die roll mechanics, how to interpret
moves and outcomes, and how to use creative prompts to drive
your story forward.
1. **Swear an Iron Vow (page 98).** Play to see what happens. When
you have questions about moves, see page 49. When you need a
foe or encounter, see page 133. When you seek answers from an
oracle, see page 165.
1. **Dig deeper (page 193).** When you’re ready to explore campaign
setup guides, additional gameplay options, and best practices, see
chapter 7.

The mother asked the seer to divine her new baby’s fate. The old mystic came and looked at the sleeping child. She tilted her head, closed her eyes. Then, she drew back, frowning. No need to ask the gods. No need to roll the stones.

“Ironsworn,” the seer said.

She took her price in silver and blood, and left the mother alone with the baby.

That night, the mother wept, for she knew her child would grow to live apart from her. Whether consumed by duty or vengeance, wanderlust or love, it was all the same. The trackless wilds would call, the blade and shadow would whisper their secrets, and her child would leave.

She cried for the life her child would live, and she cried for the knowing of it.

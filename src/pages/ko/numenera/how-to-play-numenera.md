누메네라는 모든 (마스터를 포함한) 플레이어들의 상상을 하나로 모아서 플레이합니다. 마스터는 장면을 설정하고, 플레이어는 캐릭터가 무엇을 하려 하는지 선언하며, 그리고 마스터는 무슨 일이 벌어지는지 정합니다. 한 장면은 논리적으로 다음으로 흐르고-한 마을에서 시작해서, 황야를 여행하고, 결국 이전 세계의 유적에 도착할 수 있을 겁니다- 알아차리기도 전에, 지금까지 읽거나 봐왔던 것보다 매력적인 이야기를 얻게 될 것입니다. 규칙과 주사위는 게엠이 부드럽게 흐르도록 도와주지만, 행동과 이야기 무엇보다 재미를 결정하는 건 결국 사람입니다. 룰이 게임에 방해가 된다면, 플레이어와 마스터는 함께 룰을 바꿔야 합니다.

누메네라는 20면체 주사위(d20)를 행동의 결과를 정하는데 사용합니다. 주사위를 굴려야 하는데 어떤 특정한 주사위를 굴리라고 특정하지 않으면, d20을 굴리십시오.

다음은 누메네라를 플레이하는 방법입니다:

1. 플레이어는 마스터에게 하고 싶은 일을 말합니다. 이게 캐릭터 행동입니다.
1. 마스터는 이 행동이 일상적인지 (그래서 주사위를 굴리지 않아도 되는지) 아니면 실패할 가능성이 있는지 정합니다.
1. 만약 실패할 가능성이 있다면, 마스터는 이 일이 어떤 특성(힘, 속력, 또는 지성)을 사용하는지 정하고 1(매우 쉬움)부터 10(보통 불가능)의 척도 사이에서 얼마나 어려운지 정합니다.
1. 플레이어와 마스터는 캐릭터의 무엇이던-익숙함, 장비, 특수 능력, 혹은 다양한 행동- 난이도를 한 단계 혹은 그 이상을 높이거나 낮추도록 조정할 수 있는지 정합니다. 난이도를 한 단계 낮추는 건 완화한다 하고, 난이도를 한 단계 높이는 건 방해한다 합니다. 만약 조정으로 난이도를 1보다 낮게 낮춘다면, 그 행동은 일상적인 일이 됩니다. (그렇기 때문에 주사위를 굴릴 필요가 없습니다.)
1. 만약 여전히 행동이 일상적이지 않다면, 마스터는 난이도를 가지고 목표치-플레이어가 성공하기 위해서 굴려서 얼마가 나와야 하는지-가 얼마나 높은지를 정합니다. ([일 난이도 표](#일-난이도-표)를 보십시오.) 목표치는 언제나 그 일의 난이도의 3배라서, 난이도 4인 일은 목표치가 12입니다. 성공하려면 주사위를 굴려서 목표치보다 같거나 더 높은 숫자가 나와야 합니다. 마스터는 플레이어에게 목표치가 얼마인지 말해줄 필요는 없지만, 힌트를 줄 수는 있습니다, 특히 캐릭터가 그 행동이 쉬운지 평균적인지, 어려운지 혹은 불가능한지 아는 것이 말이 되는 경우에는 그렇습니다.
1. 플레이어는 d20을 굴립니다. 만약 굴려서 목표치와 같거나 더 높게 나오면, 그 캐릭터는 성공합니다.

이게 전부입니다. 이게 신기한 기계를 알아보는 것이든, 술 취한 난동꾼을 진정시키는 것이든, 믿을 수 없는 절벽을 등반하던, 사나운 바위벌레와 싸우는 일이든, 무엇이든 하는 방법입니다. 다른 모든 규칙을 무시하더라도, 이것만 가지고도 누메네라를 플레이할 수 있습니다.

여기서 핵심만 정리하면: 캐릭터의 행동, 난이도 정하기, 조정하기(낮추기와 높이기)입니다.

## 행동하기

각 캐릭터는 각 *라운드*마다 한 차례를 받습니다. 캐릭터의 차례가 되면, 한 가지- *행동* 하나를 할 수 있습니다. 모든 행동은 세 가지 범주로 나눠집니다. 힘, 속력, 그리고 지성 (세 가지 특성과 마찬가지) 입니다.  많은 행동은 주사위를 굴려야 합니다. (d20을 굴립니다) 모든 행동은 *일*을 하는 것이고, 모든 일은 캐릭터가 성공하기 위해서 주사위를 굴려서 몇얼마를 넘어야 하는지 결정하는 *난이도*를 가지고 있습니다. 대부분의 일은 난이도가 0이며, 이는 캐릭터가 자동으로 성공한다는 뜻입니다. 예를 들어, 방을 가로질러 걸어가거나, 문을 열거나, 무언가를 바닥에서 집거나, 돌을 근처의 바구니에 집어 던지는 것은 모두 행동이지만, 무엇도 판정을 요구하지 않습니다. 보통 상황 (눈보라 속에서 목표를 쏘는 것 같은) 때문에 어렵거나 어려워지는 행동은 높은 난이도를 가집니다. 이런 행동은 보통 판정이 필요합니다.

### 언제 주사위를 굴리나?
캐릭터가 언제든 일을 시도할 때마다, 마스터는 그 일에 난이도를 정하고, d20을 굴려서 해당하는 목표치를 넘는지 봅니다. 불타는 탈것에서 뛰어내릴 때, 전투도끼를 돌연변이 짐승에게 휘두를 때, 맹렬하게 흐르는 강을 가로질러 수영할 때, 이상한 기계를 판별할 때, 상인에게 가격을 깎아달라고 할 때, 물건을 만들 때, 적의 정신을 지배하는 힘을 쓸 때, 열 광선 방출기로 벽에 구멍을 뚫을 때, 20면체를 굴려야 합니다.

하지만 난이도가 이미 0인 걸 시도한다면, 판정이 필요 없고-자동으로 성공합니다. 많은 행동은 난이도가 0입니다.  예를 들어 방을 가로질러 걷거나, 문을 열거나, 특수 능력을 이용해 중력을 무효화시켜 날거나, 능력을 써서 방사선으로부터 친구를 지키거나, (이미 이해하고 있는) 기계를 작동시키거나, 역장을 세우는 등입니다. 이들은 모두 일상적인 행동이고 판정을 요구하지 않습니다.

기능, 보탬, 그리고 분발을 사용해서, 어떤 일의 난이도라도 0으로 떨어트릴 수 있고 주사위 판정의 필요성을 무효화시킬 수 있습니다. 얇은 나무 들보 위를 걷는 건 대부분의 사람들에게 까다롭겠지만, 경험 많은 체조 선수에게는, 일상입니다. 심지어 적에 대한 공격의 난이도 역시 0으로 만들어서 판정 없이 성공할 수 있습니다. 판정이 없으면, 실패의 가능성도 없습니다. 하지만 마찬가지로 눈에 띄는 성공의 기회도 없습니다. (누메네라에서 이는 보통 굴려서 19나 20이 나오는 걸 뜻합니다. [특수 효과](#특수-효과)를 보십시오.)

### 일의 특성치 정하기
모든 일은 캐릭터의 세 가지 특성 중 하나에 연관됩니다: 힘, 속력, 혹은 지성입니다.

근력이나 힘, 혹은 지구력을 요하는 물리적 활동은 힘과 연관됩니다.

기민함, 유연함, 혹은 빠른 반응을 요하는 일은 속력과 연관됩니다.

의지력이나 기억, 정신력을 요하는 정신적 활동은 지성과 연관됩니다.

이는 일을 세 가지 범주로 일반화할 수 있다는 뜻입니다: 힘 행동, 속력 행동, 그리고 지성 행동입니다. 마찬가지로 판정 역시 세 가지 범주로 일반화할 수 있습니다: 힘 판정, 속력 판정, 그리고 지성 판정입니다. 일이나 판정의 범주는 그 판정에 어떤 분발을 해야 하는지 결정합니다.

### 일의 난이도 정하기
게임을 하는 동안 마스터가 가장 자주 하는 일은-그리고 아마도 가장 중요한 일은- 일의 난이도를 정하는 것입니다. 이 일을 쉽게 하기 위해, 난이도 점수를 해당하는 설명적인 이름과 목표치, 그리고 난이도에 대한 일반적인 조언과 연결해주는 [일 난이도 표](#일-난이도-표)를 사용하십시오.

모든 난이도는 1부터 10까지이며 해당하는목표치가 있습니다. 목표치는 외우기 쉽습니다: 항상 난이도에 3을 곱한 값입니다. 목표치는 일에서 성공하기 위해 d20을 굴려서 나와야 하는 최솟값입니다. 표 위에서 위나 아래로 움직이는 걸 난이도를 올리거나 낮춘다고 하고, 이는 단계로 측정합니다. 예를 들어 난이도 5짜리 일을 난이도 4짜리 일로 떨어트리는 것은 "난이도를 한 단계 낮춘다"고 합니다.

수정치는 캐릭터의 굴림이 아니라 난이도에 영향을 줍니다. 이는 두 가지 귀결로 이어집니다.

1. 3이나 6 같은 낮은 목표치는 d20을 쓰는 게임에서 보통 지루하지만, 누메네라에서는 아닙니다. 예를 들어, 6이나 그 이상을 굴려야 한다면, 실패할 가능성이 여전히 25%나 됩니다.
2. 높은 단계의 난이도들 (7, 8, 9, 그리고 10)은 목표치가 21이나 그 이상이라 d20을 굴려서 나올 수 없어 불가능합니다. 하지만, PC가 능력이나 장비로 일의 난이도를 낮춰서 목표치를 d20으로 굴려서 나올 수 있는 값으로 낮추는 일은 흔합니다.

난이도를 정할 때에는 캐릭터의 능력보다는 일 자체로 얻는 이득을 따라서 정해야 합니다. 난이도는 상대적이지 않습니다. 레벨4 짜리 잠긴 문은 누가 열려고 시도하더라도 여전히 똑같습니다.

### 난이도 조정하기
캐릭터의 기능들, 우호적인 상황, 혹은 탁월한 장비는 일의 난이도를 낮출 수 있습니다.

Character skills, favorable circumstances, or excellent equipment can decrease the difficulty of a task. For example, if a character is trained in climbing, they turn a difficulty 6 climb into a difficulty 5 climb. This is called “easing the task by one step.” If they’re specialized in climbing, they turn a difficulty 6 climb into a difficulty 4 climb. This is called “easing the task by two steps.”

A skill is a category of knowledge, ability, or activity relating to a task, such as climbing, geography, or persuasiveness. A character who has a skill is better at completing related tasks than a character who lacks the skill. A character’s level of skill is either trained (reasonably skilled) or specialized (very skilled).

If you are trained in a skill relating to a task, you ease that task by one step. If you are specialized, you ease it by two steps. A skill can never decrease a task’s difficulty by more than two steps.

Anything else that eases a task (help from an ally, a particular piece of equipment, or some other advantage) is referred to as an asset. Assets can never ease a task by more than two steps. You can also ease a given task by applying Effort. This costs 3 points from the relevant stat Pool, minus any Edge. Using Effort eases a task by one step.

To sum up, three things can ease a task’s difficulty: skills, assets, and Effort. If you can decrease a task’s difficulty to 0, you automatically succeed and don’t need to make a roll.

## 전투
Making an attack in combat works the same way as any other roll: the GM assigns a difficulty to the task, and you roll a d20 against the associated target number.

The difficulty of your attack roll depends on how powerful your opponent is. Just as tasks have a difficulty from 1 to 10, creatures have a level from 1 to 10. Most of the time, the difficulty of your attack roll is the same as the creature’s level. For example, if you attack a level 2 bandit, it’s a level 2 task, so your target number is 6.

Players make all die rolls. If a character attacks a creature, the player makes an attack roll. If a creature attacks a character, the player makes a defense roll.

The damage dealt by an attack is a flat number based on the weapon or attack used. For example, a spear always does 4 points of damage.

Your Armor characteristic reduces the damage you take from attacks directed at you. You get Armor from wearing physical armor (such as a sturdy leather jerkin or chainmail) or from special abilities. Like weapon damage, Armor is a flat number, not a roll. If you’re attacked, subtract your Armor from the damage you take. For example, a leather jerkin gives you 1 point of Armor, meaning that you take 1 less point of damage from attacks. If a bandit hits you with a knife for 2 points of damage while you’re wearing a leather jerkin, you take only 1 point of damage. If your Armor reduces the damage from an attack to 0, you take no damage from that attack.

When you see the word “Armor” capitalized in the game rules (other than as the name of a special ability), it refers to your Armor characteristic—the number you subtract from incoming damage. When you see the word “armor” with a lowercase “a,” it refers to any physical armor you might wear.

Typical physical weapons come in three categories: light, medium and heavy.

**LIGHT WEAPONS** inflict only 2 points of damage, but they ease the attack roll by one step because they are fast and easy to use. Light weapons are punches, kicks, clubs, knives, handaxes, rapiers, and so on. Weapons that are particularly small are light weapons.

**MEDIUM WEAPONS** inflict 4 points of damage. Medium weapons include swords, battleaxes, maces, crossbows, spears, and so on. Most weapons are medium. Anything that could be used in one hand (even if it’s often used in two hands, such as a quarterstaff or spear) is a medium weapon.

**HEAVY WEAPONS** inflict 6 points of damage, and you must use two hands to attack with them. Heavy weapons are huge swords, great hammers, massive axes, halberds, heavy crossbows, and so on. Anything that must be used in two hands is a heavy weapon.

### 공격 수정치와 특수한 상황
In combat situations, many modifiers might come into play. The GM is at liberty to assess whatever modifiers they think are appropriate to the situation (that’s their role in the game). Often the modifier is applied as a step in difficulty. So if a situation hinders attacks, that means if a PC attacks a nonplayer character (NPC), the difficulty for the attack roll is increased by one step, and if an NPC attacks a PC, the difficulty of the defense roll is decreased by one step. This is because players make all rolls, whether they are attacking or defending— NPCs never make attack or defense rolls. When in doubt, if it seems like it should be harder to attack in a situation, the attack rolls are hindered by one step. If it seems like attacks should gain an advantage or be easier in some way, the defense rolls are eased by one step.

### 피해를 주고 받기
When an attack strikes a character, it usually means the character takes damage.
An attack against a PC subtracts points from one of the character’s stat Pools—usually the Might Pool. Whenever an attack simply says it deals “damage” without specifying the type, it means Might damage, which is by far the most

common type. Intellect damage, which is usually
the result of a mental attack, is always labeled
as Intellect damage. Speed damage is often
a physical attack, but attacks that deal Speed
damage are fairly rare.
NPCs don’t have stat Pools. Instead, they
have a characteristic called health. When an
NPC takes damage of any kind, the amount is
subtracted from its health. Unless described
otherwise, an NPC’s health is always equal to its
target number. Some NPCs might have special
reactions to or defenses against attacks that
would normally deal Speed damage or Intellect
damage, but unless the NPC’s description
specifically explains this, assume that all damage
is subtracted from the NPC’s health.
Objects have a damage track that works like
the damage track for PCs. Attacking an object
with a melee weapon is a Might action against
the object’s level.
As mentioned previously, damage is always a
specific amount determined by the attack. For
example, a slash with a broadsword inflicts 4
points of damage. A Nano’s Onslaught force
inflicts deals 4 points of damage. Often, there
are ways for the attacker to increase the damage.
For example, a PC can apply Effort to deal 3
additional points of damage, and rolling a
natural 17 on the attack roll inflicts 1 additional
point of damage.


<div class="numenera-box">

### 부상 트랙
**Hale** is the normal state for a character: all three stat Pools are at 1 or higher, and the PC has no penalties from harmful
conditions. When a hale PC takes enough damage to reduce one of their stat Pools to 0, they become impaired. Note that
a character whose stat Pools are much lower than normal can still be hale.

<br/>

**Impaired** is a wounded or injured state. When an impaired character applies Effort, it costs 1 extra point per level applied.
For example, applying one level of Effort costs 4 points instead of 3, and applying two levels of Effort costs 7 points instead
of 5.
An impaired character ignores minor and major effect results on their rolls, and they don’t deal as much extra damage
in combat with a special roll. In combat, a roll of 17 or higher deals only 1 additional point of damage.
When an impaired PC takes enough damage to reduce one of their stat Pools to 0, they become debilitated.

<br/>

**Debilitated** is a critically injured state. A debilitated character can’t take any actions other than to move (probably crawl) no
more than an immediate distance. If a debilitated character’s Speed Pool is 0, they can’t move at all.
When a debilitated PC takes enough damage to reduce a stat Pool to 0, they are dead.

<br/>

**Dead** is dead.

</div>

### 주변 피해
Some kinds of damage aren’t direct attacks
against a creature, but they indirectly affect
everything in the area. Most of these are
environmental effects such as winter cold, high
temperatures, or background radiation. Damage
from these kinds of sources is called ambient
damage. Physical armor usually doesn’t protect

against ambient damage, though a well-insulated
suit of armor can protect against cold weather.

#### 피해의 효과
When an NPC reaches 0 health, it is either
dead or (if the attacker wishes it) incapacitated,
meaning unconscious or beaten into submission.
As previously mentioned, damage from most
sources is applied to a character’s Might Pool.
Otherwise, stat damage always reduces the Pool
of the stat it affects.
If damage reduces a character’s stat Pool to 0,
any further damage to that stat (including excess
damage from the attack that reduced the stat
to 0) is applied to another stat Pool. Damage is
applied to Pools in this order:

1. Might Pool (unless the Pool is 0)
2. Speed Pool (unless the Pool is 0)
3. Intellect Pool


Even if the damage is applied to another
stat Pool, it still counts as its original type for
the purpose of Armor and special abilities that
affect damage. For example, if a Glaive with 2
Armor is reduced to 0 Might and then is hit
by a monster’s claw for 3 points of damage, it
still counts as Might damage, so their 2 Armor
reduces the damage to 1 point, which then is
applied to their Speed Pool. In other words, even
though the Glaive takes the damage from their
Speed Pool, it doesn’t ignore Armor like Speed
damage normally would.
In addition to taking damage from their Might
Pool, Speed Pool, or Intellect Pool, PCs also have
a damage track. The damage track has four states
(from best to worst): hale, impaired, debilitated,
and dead. When one of a PC’s stat Pools
reaches 0, the character moves one step down
the damage track. Thus, if they are hale, they

become impaired. If they are already impaired,
they become debilitated. If they are already
debilitated, they become dead.
Some effects can immediately shift a PC
one or more steps on the damage track. These
include rare poisons, cellular disruption attacks,
and massive traumas (such as falls from very
great heights, being run over by a speeding
vehicle, and so on, as determined by the GM).
Some attacks, like venom from a serpent’s
bite, a hibernation device or the explosive
secretions of a chalik, have effects other than
damage to a stat Pool or shifting the PC on
the damage track. These attacks can cause
unconsciousness, paralysis, and so on.

<div class="numenera-box">

### 사물 부상 트랙

Intact is the default state for an object.
Minor damage is a slightly damaged state.
An object with minor damage reduces its
level by 1.
Major damage is a critically damaged state.
An object with major damage is broken and
no longer functions.
Destroyed is destroyed. The object is ruined,
no longer functions, and cannot be repaired.
If the Might action to damage an object is
a success, the object moves one step down
the object damage track. If the Might roll
exceeded the difficulty by 2 levels, the object
instead moves two steps down the object
damage track. If the Might roll exceeded the
difficulty by 4 levels, the object instead moves
three steps down the object damage track.

</div>

### 역량 점수 회복하기
After losing or spending points in a Pool, you
recover those points by resting. You can’t
increase a Pool past its maximum by resting—
just back to its normal level. Any extra points
gained go away with no effect. The amount of
points you recover from a rest, and how long
each rest takes, depends on how many times you
have rested so far that day.
When you rest, make a recovery roll. To do
this, roll 1d6 + 1. You recover that many points,
and you can divide them among your stat Pools
however you wish. For example, if your recovery
roll is 4 and you’ve lost 4 points of Might and
2 points of Speed, you can recover 4 points
of Might, or 2 points of Might and 2 points of
Speed, or any other combination adding up to 4
points.
The first time you rest each day, it takes only a
few seconds to catch your breath. If you rest this
way in the middle of an encounter, it takes one
action on your turn.
The second time you rest each day, you must
rest ten minutes to make a recovery roll. The third
time you rest each day, you must rest one hour to
make a recovery roll. The fourth time you rest each
day, you must rest ten hours to make a recovery
roll (usually, this occurs when you sleep).
After that much rest, it’s assumed to be a new
day (Ninth World days are 28 hours long), so the
next time you rest, it takes only a few seconds.
The next rest takes ten minutes, then one hour,
and so on, in a cycle.
If you haven’t rested yet that day and you take
a lot of damage in a fight, you could rest a few
seconds (regaining 1d6 points + 1)
and then immediately rest for ten minutes
(regaining another 1d6 points + 1). Thus, in one
full day of doing nothing but resting, you could
recover 4d6 points + 4 points.
Each character chooses when to make
recovery rolls. If a party of five explorers rests for

ten minutes because two members want to make
recovery rolls, the other characters don’t have to
make rolls at that time. Later in the day, those
three can decide to rest for ten minutes and
make recovery rolls.

Recovery Roll Rest Time Needed
First recovery roll One action
Second recovery roll Ten minutes
Third recovery roll One hour
Fourth recovery roll Ten hours
Using points from a recovery roll to raise a
stat Pool from 0 to 1 or higher also automatically
moves the character up one step on the damage
track.
If all of a PC’s stat Pools are above 0 and the
character has taken special damage that moved
them down the damage track, they can use a
recovery roll to move up one step on the damage
track instead of recovering points. For example,
a Jack who is debilitated from a hit with a celldisrupting numenera device can rest and move up
to impaired rather than recover points in a Pool.

### 특수 효과
When you roll a natural 19 (the d20 shows
“19”) and the roll is a success, you also have a
minor effect. In combat, a minor effect inflicts 3
additional points of damage with your attack, or,
if you’d prefer a special result, you could decide
instead that you knock the foe back, distract
them, or something similar. When not in combat,
a minor effect could mean that you perform the
action with particular grace. For example, when
jumping down from a ledge, you land smoothly
on your feet, or when trying to persuade
someone, you convince them that you’re smarter
than you really are. In other words, you not only
succeed but also go a bit further.
When you roll a natural 20 (the d20 shows
“20”) and the roll is a success, you also have
a major effect. This is similar to a minor effect,
but the results are more remarkable. In combat,
a major effect inflicts 4 additional points of
damage with your attack, but again, you can
choose instead to introduce a dramatic event
such as knocking down your foe, stunning them,
or taking an extra action. Outside of combat, a
major effect means that something beneficial
happens based on the circumstance. For
example, when climbing up a cliff wall, you make
the ascent twice as fast. When a roll grants you
a major effect, you can choose to use a minor
effect instead if you prefer.
In combat (and only in combat), if you roll a
natural 17 or 18 on your attack roll, you add 1 or
2 points of damage, respectively. Neither roll
has any special effect options—just the extra
damage.
Rolling a natural 1 is always bad. It means that
the GM introduces a new complication into the
encounter. This is called a GM intrusion.

1: Intrusion. The GM makes a free intrusion
(see below) and doesn’t award experience points
(XP) for it.
17: Damage Bonus. If the roll was an attack, it
deals 1 additional point of damage.
18: Damage Bonus. If the roll was an attack, it
deals 2 additional points of damage.
19: Minor Effect. If the roll was an attack, it
deals 3 additional points of damage. If the roll
was something other than an attack, the PC gets
a minor effect in addition to the normal results
of the task.
20: Major Effect. If the roll was an attack, it
deals 4 additional points of damage. If the roll
was something other than an attack, the PC gets
a major effect in addition to the normal results
of the task. If the PC spent points from a stat
Pool on the action, the point cost for the action
decreases to 0, meaning the character regains
those points as if they had not been spent at all.

## 마스터 개입
GM intrusion reflects when something in the
story occurs to complicate the character’s life.
The character hasn’t necessarily fumbled or
done anything wrong (although perhaps they
did). It could just be that the task presents an
unexpected difficulty or something unrelated
affects the current situation.

<div class="numenera-box">

## 협동
If you use your action to help someone with a task, you ease the task. If you have an inability in a task, your help has no
effect. If you use your action to help someone with a task that you are trained or specialized in, the task is eased by two
steps. Help is considered an asset, and someone receiving help usually can’t gain more than two assets on a single task if
that help is provided by another character.
For example, if Veterian the Glaive is trying to climb a steep incline and Jethua the Jack (who is trained in climbing)
spends her turn helping him, Veterian can decrease the difficulty of the task by two steps.

> Help is considered an asset, and someone receiving help usually can’t gain more than two assets on a single task if that help is provided by another character. 

At any time, the GM can introduce an
unexpected complication for a character. For
example, an enemy might appear and attack,
the rope the character is climbing might snap,
or an unstable floor might give out beneath a
character’s feet. A GM intrusion always puts
the spotlight on that one character, and when
the GM finishes explaining what the sudden,
surprising turn of events is, they ask that player,
“Now what do you do?” They player must deal
with this new complication.
When the GM intrudes in this manner, they
must give the affected character 2 XP. That
player, in turn, must immediately give one of
those XP to another player and justify the gift
(perhaps the other player had a good idea, told a
funny joke, performed an action that saved a life,
and so on).
As a general rule, the GM should intrude at
least once each session, but probably no more
than once or twice each session per character.
Anytime the GM intrudes, the player can spend
1 XP to refuse the intrusion, though that also
means they don’t get the 2 XP. If the player has no
XP to spend, they can’t refuse the intrusion.
Example Intrusion: Through skill and the aid of
another character, a PC eases a wall climbing
task from difficulty 2 to difficulty 0. Normally,
they would succeed at the task automatically,
but the GM intrudes and says, “No, a bit of the
crumbling wall gives way, so you still have to
make a roll.” As with any difficulty 2 task, the
target number is 6. The PC attempts the roll
as normal, and because the GM intruded, the
character gains 2 XP. They immediately give one
of those XP to another player.
Another Example Intrusion: During a fight, a
PC swings their axe and damages a foe with a
slice across the shoulder. The GM intrudes by
saying that the foe turned just as the axe struck,
wrenching the weapon from the character’s grip
and sending it clattering across the floor. The
axe comes to a stop 10 feet (3 m) away. Because
the GM intruded, the PC gains 2 XP, and they
immediately give one of those XP to another
player. Now the character must deal with the
dropped weapon, perhaps drawing a different
weapon or using their next turn to scramble after
the axe.

If a character rolls a 1 on a die, the GM can
intrude without giving the character any XP. This
kind of intrusion happens immediately or very
soon thereafter.

## 거리와 속도
Distance is simplified into three categories:
immediate, short, and long.
IMMEDIATE DISTANCE from a character is
within reach or within a few steps. If a character
stands in a small room, everything in the room is
within immediate distance. At most, immediate
distance is 10 feet (3 m).
SHORT DISTANCE is anything greater than
immediate distance but less than 50 feet
(15 m) or so.
LONG DISTANCE is anything greater than short
distance but less than 100 feet (30 m) or so.
VERY LONG distance is anything greater than
long distance but less than 500 feet (150 m) or
so.
Beyond that range, distances are always
specified—1000 feet (300 m), 1 mile (1.6 km),
and so on.
The idea is that it’s not necessary to measure
precise distances. Immediate distance is right
there, practically next to the character. Short
distance is nearby. Long distance is farther off.
All weapons and special abilities use these
terms for ranges. For example, all melee
weapons have immediate range—they are
close-combat weapons, and you can use them
to attack anyone within immediate distance of
you. A thrown knife (and most other thrown
weapons) has short range. A bow has long range.
A Nano’s Onslaught ability also has short range.
A character can move an immediate distance
as part of another action. In other words, they
can take a few steps over to the control panel
and activate a switch. They can lunge across a
small room to attack a foe. They can open a door
and step through.

A character can move a short distance as their
entire action for a turn. They can also try to move
a long distance as their entire action, but the
player might have to roll to see if their character
slips, trips, or stumbles as the result of moving
so far so quickly.
For example, if the PCs are fighting a group
of abhumans, any character can likely attack
any abhuman in the general melee—they’re
all within immediate range. Exact positions
aren’t important. Creatures in a fight are always
moving, shifting, and jostling, anyway. However,
if one abhuman stayed back to use its crossbow,
a character might have to use their entire action
to move the short distance required to attack
that foe. It doesn’t matter if the abhuman is 20
feet (6 m) or 40 feet (12 m) away—it’s simply
considered short distance. It does matter if
the abhuman is more than 50 feet (15 m) away
because that distance would require a long
move.

## 초점 장면, 라운드, 행동 순서
Sometimes in the course of the game, the GM
or players will refer to an encounter. Encounters
are not so much measurements of time as they
are events or instances in which something
happens, like a scene of a movie or a chapter in a
book. An encounter might be a fight with a foe, a
dramatic crossing of a raging river, or a stressful
negotiation with an important official. It’s useful
to use the word when referring to a specific
scene, as in “My Might Pool is low after that
encounter with the blacktusk yesterday.”
A round is about five to ten seconds. The
length of time is variable because sometimes
one round might be a bit longer than another.
You don’t need to measure time more precisely
than that. You can estimate that on average there
are about ten rounds in a minute. In a round,
everyone—each character and NPC—gets to
take one action.
To determine who goes first, second, and so
on in a round, each player makes a Speed roll
called an initiative roll. Most of the time, it’s only
important to know which characters act before
the NPCs and which act after the NPCs. On an
initiative roll, a character who rolls higher than
an NPC’s target number takes their action before
the NPC does. As with all target numbers, an
NPC’s initiative roll target number is three times
the NPC’s level. Many times, the GM will have all
NPCs take their actions at the same time, using
the highest target number from among all the
NPCs. Using this method, any characters who
rolled higher than the target number act first,
then all the NPCs act, and finally any characters
who rolled lower than the target number act.
The order in which the characters act usually
isn’t important. If the players want to go in a
precise order, they can act in initiative order
(highest to lowest), by going around the table, by
going oldest to youngest, and so on.
For example, Colin, James, and Shanna are
in combat with two level 2 abhumans. The GM
has the players make Speed rolls to determine
initiative. Colin rolls an 8, Shanna rolls a 15, and
James rolls a 4. The target number for a level 2
creature is 6, so each round Colin and Shanna
act before the abhumans, then the abhumans
act, and finally James acts. It doesn’t matter
whether Colin acts before or after Shanna, as
long as they think it’s fair.
After everyone—all PCs and NPCs—in the
combat has had a turn, the round ends and a
new round begins. In all rounds after the first,
everyone acts in the same order as they did in
the first round. The characters cycle through this
order until the logical end of the encounter (the
end of the fight or the completion of the event)
or until the GM asks them to make new initiative
rolls. The GM can call for new initiative rolls at
the beginning of any new round when conditions
drastically change. For example, if the NPCs
gain reinforcements, the environment changes
(perhaps the lights go out), the terrain changes
(maybe part of the balcony collapses under the
PCs), or something similar occurs, the GM can
call for new initiative rolls.
Since the action moves as a cycle, anything
that lasts for a round ends where it started in the
cycle. If Valleris the Nano uses an esotery on an
opponent that hinders its defenses for one round,
the effect lasts until Valleris acts on his next turn.

## 상호작용
Obviously, players can talk to each other all they
want, and at least some of that conversation
represents what the characters are saying to each
other. Often, a PC will want to talk to an NPC. It
might be to haggle with a shopkeeper, convince a
guard to let them pass by, or just get information
from someone in the know. This conversation
is normally handled by the GM taking on the
NPC role and talking things through. When
a PC tries to convince an NPC of something,
or when they try to deceive or intimidate the
NPC, a roll is involved. This is handled just like
anything else—use the level of the NPC as the
difficulty, modified by the circumstances. Trying
to convince a loyal soldier to disobey orders
is harder than their level might indicate, but
convincing the soldier that new orders have

come in might be normal. Skills like persuasion
or deception might help, and of course Effort can
be used (usually Intellect).

## 탐험과 발견
Although fighting dangerous beasts or other
foes can be interesting and exciting, much of
gameplay in Numenera probably involves other
situations: overcoming obstacles, interacting
with NPCs (some of them being weird creatures,
machine intelligences, or far stranger things!),
figuring out bits of ancient technology, solving
mysteries, finding solutions to problems, blazing
trails through the wilderness, sneaking, climbing,
running, and all other kinds of exciting activities.
Sometimes these actions allow PCs to achieve
goals, such as “find the lost child in the woods,”
or “help escort a merchant to the next town.”
But more often than not, they propel characters
toward making discoveries.
The core of gameplay in Numenera—the
answer to the question “What do characters do
in this game?”—is “Discover new things or old
things that are new again—and then use them to
build a better future.” This can be the discovery
of something a character can use, like an artifact.
It makes the character more powerful because
it almost certainly grants a new capability or
option, but it’s also a discovery unto itself and
results in a gain of experience points.
Discovery can also mean finding a new
numenera procedure or device (something too
big to be considered a piece of equipment) or
even previously unknown information. If the PCs
find an ancient hovertrain and get it working
again so they can use it to reach a distant
location, that’s a discovery. If they locate a signal
receiving station and figure out how to turn off
the transmission from an overhead satellite



that’s causing all the animals in the region to
become hostile, that’s a discovery. The common
thread is that the PCs discover something that
they can understand and put to use. A cure
for a plague, the means to draw power from a
hydroelectric plant, an operational flying craft, or
an injection that grants the knowledge to create
a protective force field dome over a structure—
these are all discoveries.
The GM should award between 1 and 4 XP at
the end of a session if the characters made any
significant discoveries.
## 경험치
Experience points (XP) are rewards given to
players when the GM intrudes on the story
(this is called GM intrusion) with a new and
unexpected challenge. For example, in the middle
of combat, the GM might inform the player that
they drop their weapon. However, to intrude in
this manner, the GM must award the player 2 XP.
The rewarded player, in turn, must immediately
give one of those XP to another player and justify
the gift (perhaps the other player had a good
idea, told a funny joke, performed an action that
saved a life, and so on).
Alternatively, the player can refuse the GM
intrusion. If they do so, they don’t get the 2 XP
from the GM, and they must also spend 1 XP
that they already have. If the player has no XP to
spend, they can’t refuse the intrusion.
The GM can also give players XP between
sessions as a reward for recovering interesting
artifacts or making discoveries during an
adventure. You don’t earn XP for killing foes or
overcoming standard challenges in the course of
play. Discovery is the soul of Numenera.
A player can spend XP they’ve accumulated to
reroll any die roll and take the better of the two
rolls. Rerolling costs 1 XP.

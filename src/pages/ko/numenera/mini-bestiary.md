### BLACKTUSK 4 (12)
A cry that reverberates with what sounds like anguish typifies the hunting yowl of a distant pride of
blacktusks. Those familiar with the noise know to find shelter, lest they become the pride’s target.
A blacktusk is a catlike mammal over 7 feet (2 m) long with massive tusks. The creature’s pelt is
snow white, while its tusks are black as cloudy night in the Frozen South. A few populations of these
savage hunters exist here and there across the world, but almost exclusively in areas of extreme cold.
When humans venture into such areas, blacktusk prides might run them down as fresh food, or leave
the newcomers alone and focus on prey they’re more familiar with.
Hunters in lands far from the Steadfast are sometimes accompanied by trained blacktusks, which
have been raised from kits to be companions in the hunt. Such blacktusks can be distinguished from
their wild kin by the glowing cords of hemp-like material wrapped around their necks like collars.
Motive: Hunger or loyalty
Environment: Anywhere cold
Health: 12
Damage Inflicted: 5 points
Movement: Long
Modifications: Speed defense as level 6 due to quickness.
Combat: Blacktusks typically attack with their eponymous tusks, which inflict 5 points of
damage, although they might also claw or pounce. If a blacktusk pounces, it is usually
because the creature is attacking with surprise, or because it takes its first turn before its foe.
A pounce attack inflicts normal damage but the victim must succeed on a Might defense
task or be knocked down and pinned beneath the blacktusk until it can escape. Each round a
victim remains pinned, the blacktusk savages it for 6 points of damage.
Blacktusks work together when hunting to increase their chances of bringing down prey,
including more powerful creatures. Three or more blacktusks working in concert to attack
the same target reduces the difficulty of one blacktusk’s attack against the target by two
steps.
Interaction: Wild blacktusks are vicious and cunning predators, but they are not suicidal, and
if they have reason to believe their prey may be more than they can handle, they will break
off an attack. If a lone
blacktusk is encountered,
especially one wearing
a rope collar, it’s likely a
trained companion of some
other creature, which is
probably nearby.
Use: As encounters in cold
wilds go, blacktusks are a
great standby, especially
if the PCs later encounter
one as an NPC’s “tame”
companion.
GM Intrusion: The
character injured by
the blacktusk begins
to bleed from the tusk
wound, taking 2 points
of damage each round
(ignores Armor) until
the PC spends an action
bandaging the wound.

### CHALIK 2 (6)
Chaliks are 1-foot (30 cm) long insects protected by elaborate yellow carapaces. They attack larger
prey in small groups by sacrificing some of their number to catch and immobilize targets, allowing
the remaining chaliks to freely attack and feed. They produce a surprisingly sticky secretion when
killed or when they sacrifice themselves. They’re found in warm wastelands, caverns, ruins, and
sometimes run-down parts of human communities. Because chaliks can produce such a powerful
bonding agent, craftspeople and others sometimes collect them for their fluid.
Motive: Hungers for flesh
Environment: Almost anywhere except cold areas in groups of ten or more
Health: 6
Damage Inflicted: 2 points
Armor: 1
Movement: Short; short when climbing
Modifications: Speed defense as level 4 due to size.
Combat: Chaliks swarm a foe and bite with their mandibles. A group of four or more chaliks
can attack as a single level 4 creature that inflicts 5 points of damage. Alternatively, a single
chalik can contract its abdomen and cause the glands inside to burst,
resulting in a gush of sticky secretions from its mouth (and in that
chalik’s death). This is a level 4 attack that inflicts no damage, but a
single targeted victim who fails a Speed defense task is covered
in the secretion and immobilized (and
unable to take actions other than
attempt to break free) until it can
escape. Attacks against a target
immobilized by chalik secretions are
two steps less difficult.
Chalik carapaces slough off their own
secretions so they don’t become stuck
in the sticky material provided by their
fellows.
Interaction: Chaliks are essentially
insects, despite their size.
Use: A fight with an NPC becomes a
lot more dangerous when the NPC
knocks one of the characters into
what turns out to be a chalik nest.
GM Intrusion: When
the chalik is killed, it
explodes. A character
within immediate range
is attacked as if by a
chalik sacrificing itself to
immobilize a target.

### 감시자 Gazer 1 (3)
![](/gazer2.png)

A gazer is a levitating metallic spherical automaton, about 1.5 feet (0.5 m) in diameter. Various bits
of equipment and blinking cyphers festoon a gazer’s battered alloy body. A concavity on one side of
the sphere incessantly emits a beam of scarlet light. Blinding at best, the red beam can intensify in a
moment, creating a ray capable of burning through nearly anything.
Motive: Defense
Environment: Formations of six to twelve gazers might be found defending ancient ruined
installations. Sometimes lone gazers are encountered as companions of jacks or nanos who
reprogrammed it to act as a servitor.
Health: 3
Damage Inflicted: 2 points
Armor: 1
Movement: Long while flying
Modifications: Perception as level 5; Speed defense as level 2 due to size.
Combat: Groups of gazers fly in a spherical formation, which allows them to present the maximum
possible perception and threat surface.
A gazer can fire its scarlet beam to attack a target at long range. If the gazer can see any part of
its target, it ignores any difficulty step penalties for cover that the target might have otherwise
enjoyed.
As few as three gazers can act as a swarm, focusing their attack on one target to make one attack roll
as a single level 3 creature, dealing 4 points of damage. On a miss, a swarm of gazers still deals 1
point of damage.
The intensity of a gazer’s beam is level 5 (as measured against the level of material of an inanimate
object to be burned through).
Interaction: A gazer usually interacts only by flashing its beam in coded bursts, accompanied by eerie
bleats of electronic static. Most active gazers follow a program to defend a location, reconnoiter a
wider area, or seek and destroy those who match profiles held in their machine brains. However,
if any group of gazers is interfered with too much, they will eradicate the perceived threat.
Use: Stories of the discovery of a rusted, crumbling cache of spheres laden with numenera reach the
PCs. What’s actually been discovered is a decommissioned gazer graveyard on the outskirts of an
ancient war installation. A few gazer formations are still active.
Loot: Scavengers can recover 1d6 cyphers in the remains of a destroyed swarm.
Gazers are speculated
to be antiques of a
forgotten war that were
originally forged by the
millions, Only a handful
remain active. However,
if one of the ancient
warehouses could be
discovered, that number
could radically increase.
GM Intrusion: A
gazer destroyed by an
attack explodes, dealing
5 points of damage to
every creature in short
range. Other gazers
in immediate range
spin away to safety.

### ICE WEAVER 3 (9)
Delicate, lattice-like ice structures created by ice weavers are often mistaken as some kind of
manifestation of the prior worlds. But these structures usually last only a few days or months before
cracking, breaking, and melting away.
When a pack of ice weaver hunters moves into a new area, they first construct a redoubt of woven ice.
When explorers or residents of isolated communities find such “ice castles,” they should beware. Ice
weavers are near. Luckily the creatures never stay in the same area long.
Ice weavers absorb heat and excrete ice. About 12 feet (4 m) long, these low-slung predators are
clad in frost scales, complete with many transparent spikes and barbs. Condensation vapor often
swirls from their super-cold bodies, and they race along the ground by producing a layer of ice along
which they can slide.
Motive: Hungers for flesh
Environment: Almost anywhere in packs of three to eight
Health: 9
Damage Inflicted: 4 points
Armor: 4 (see Combat)
Movement: Long
Modifications: Speed defense as level 4.
Combat: Ice weavers race quickly on self-created narrow lanes of ice and use that speed to their
advantage in combat. An ice weaver can move a long distance and attack as a single action.
It can also use its action to create a lane that stretches up above the heads of its prey, so
that they can’t reach it that round unless they try to climb an elevated, slippery ice lane (a
difficulty 6 Might task).
When an ice weaver bites down on a foe, it drains heat and inflicts 4 points of Speed damage
(ignores Armor). Completely frozen victims are dragged off and consumed later.
Anyone within immediate range of an ice weaver suffers 1 point of cold damage each round.
Interaction: Ice weavers are intelligent, but they prize hunting more than almost any other
activity. Excess frozen prey is stored in lairs hidden in high glaciers, where ice weaver young
are reared. Someone threatening a supply of frozen food or a weaver lair could get a pack to
back off or move away from an area.
Use: Characters hear about a “prior-world ruin” that appeared without warning. When they
investigate, they find no ruin, but the small village nearby is vacated and empty. The only
clue about what happened is a muddy trail leading north.

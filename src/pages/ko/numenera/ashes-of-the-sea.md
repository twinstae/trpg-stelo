바다의 재는 누메네라를 위한 완전한 시나리오입니다. 10억년 뒤 미래의 지구를 무대로, 누메네라에서 플레이어들은 탐험가이자 모험가의 역할을 맡아, 오래 전에 사라진 지난 세계의 비밀을 밝혀냅니다.

이 시나리오(adventure)에서, 플레이어 캐릭터(PC)들은 우연한 사고로 이상한 고대 문명의 기술 유적 근처에 있는 머나먼 마을로 순간이동하게 됩니다. PC들은 금지된 구조물에 들어게 해달라고 마을 사람들을 설득하고, 부서진 순간이동 장치를 고칠 기계를 찾거나 만들어야 하며, 장치는 PC들이 집에 돌려보내주거나-어쩌면 세계의 어디라도 가게 해줄 겁니다!

이 책자 안에서 플레이하는데 필요한 모든 것을 찾으실 수 있습니다. 그리고 QR코드를 이용해 사전 제작된 여섯 캐릭터들의 PDF 파일을 다운 받는 것도 잊지 마세요.[^]

## 순간이동 사고
PC들은 고대 문명의 알 수 없는 존재에게 버려진 기지를 탐험하고 있었습니다. 목표는 *누메네라*(numenera)-기계나 기계 부품으로 놀라운 효과를 만들어내는데 쓰일 수 있습니다-라고 부르는 유용한 기술을 찾는 것이었고, 적당히 성공적이어서, *사이퍼*(cyphers)라 부르는 유용한 물건들과(salvaging), *아이오툼*(iotum)이라 가치있는 기술들의 구성 성분, 사람들이 *쉰*(shins)이라고 부르며 돈으로 쓰는 신기하게 생긴 조각들도 찾아냈습니다. 그 뒤에 무슨 일이 벌어지는지는 플레이어들이 누메네라에 얼마나 익숙하고 경험이 있는지에 달려 있습니다.

**새로운/경험이 없는 플레이어들:** 만약 플레이어들이 누메네라가 처음이거나, 마스터가 세팅의 일부를 설명해야겠다고 느낀다면, 플레이어들이 이전 세계의 폐허에서 간단한 장면을 몇 개 만들도록 해서, 시스템이 어떻게 작동하는지 배울 수 있게 해주세요. (큰 방에서 누메네라 물건들을 찾는다든가, 부서진 누메네라 기계에서 쉰을 찾는다든가, 유적을 파괴하는 걸 막기 위해 작동된 한 쌍의 [감시자 Gazer](/ko/numenera/mini-bestiary#감시자-gazer-1-3)들과 싸운다든가.) 플레이어들이 게임의 규칙이 편안하다고 느낄 쯤이면, 이전 탐험가들이 건드리지 않은 것처럼 보이는 봉인된 방을 찾게 하고, 그 방에서 찾은 수상한 기계를 작동시키게 하거나 - 아니면 자동으로 작동하게 해서- 이 시나리오에 쓰여진 부분의 시작으로 순간이동하게 하세요. (아래의 ["도착"](#도착)을 참고하세요.)

**경험이 있는/숙련된 플레이어들:** 플레이어들이 누메네라에 친숙하거나, 마스터가 플레이어들이 새로운 세계와 시스템에 뛰어들어도 잘 해낼 수 있을 거라 느낀다면, 순간이동의 방은 시나리오에 뒷 이야기 중 한 부분으로 하고, PC들이 순간이동 목적지에 도착한 시점부터 플레이를 시작해도 됩니다.

## 도착
이전 탐험가들에의해 약탈되지 않았던 방을 열고 나면, PC들은 우연히 기계를 작동시키고, 역장 거품에 갇혀 기이한 빛을 맞게 됩니다. 온 방이 점점 더 높은 빈도로 진동하고, 패널이 터지고 연기를 내뿜으며, 마침내 큰 빛과 함께 PC들은 어딘가... 다른 곳으로 순간이동합니다.

번쩍이는 빛이 옅어지면서, 누군가 PC들을 확 잡아채서 불가능할 정도로 얇게 늘이는 것 같은 기분이 들고, PC들은 새로운 장소에 있다는 걸 알아차리게 됩니다. 작고 소박하고, 빛이 잘 드는 방에 있었는데, 이제는 청동색 금속으로 만든 돔으로 덮인 격납고 같은 곳에 있는 것입니다. 그곳은 얼어붙을듯이 차갑고, 크고 열린 문에서 희미한 빛만이 들어오고 있습니다. 얕은 층의 눈이 바닥의 대부분을 덮고 있는데, 특히 큰 문 근처로 갈 수록 심합니다.

눈이 없는 곳에는, 식별하기 어려운 일련의 기호들이 바닥에 그려진 것을 PC들은 볼 수 있는데, 이 방의 대부분을 차지하는 원의 둘레를 따라가고 있습니다, 그 선과 점들은 거의 바래지고 닳아져 있습니다. 금속 패널은 벽에서 삐져나와 헐거워져 있고, 드러난 선과 케이블, 그리고 흥미롭거나 값어치 있는 건 모두 오래 전에 쓸어갔다는 걸 보여주는 단서들이 명백합니다.

이 장소에는 PC들이 쓸만한 자원이 전혀 없습니다. —살아남고 싶다면, 음식도 필요하고 몸을 피할 곳도 있어야 하고, 그리고 날씨에 맞는 옷도 찾아야 합니다, 건물을 뒤진다면, 찾는 것은 전부 다 합쳐도 쓸모 없는 금속과 *신스*[^신스] 조각들 (나사나 꼬인 끈, 등등) 그리고 많은 눈 뿐입니다. 찬 바람이 불어오고, 땅에 쌓인 눈들은 이 곳을 황량하고 불편하게 보이게 합니다.[^역주1]

> Because of the extreme cold, PCs take 1 point of damage every ten minutes they spend here. This damage ignores armor (but not cyphers or character abilities that protect against cold damage). If they’re wearing cold-weather clothing, they take this damage only once per hour.

### 산

The building seems to be on a high slope of a
tall mountain range extending north and south.
A few gnarled trees jut out of the snow here and
there. To the east, the mountain extends upward
in a sharp incline toward some forbidding peaks.
To the west, the mountain slopes downward
toward a green valley surrounded by a white
distortion in the air. It looks like there are about
two hours of daylight left.

> 플레이어들이 누메네라를 전에 해보지 않았거나, 전투를 매우 하고 싶어한다면 몇 마리의 [검은 엄니](/ko/numenera/mini-bestiary#검은-엄니-black-tusk-4-12)와 조우하게 해서 전투를 어떻게 하는지 보여주고, 캐릭터 능력을 써볼 수 있게 해주는 것도 고려해보세요.

The “snow” is tiny flakes of a hard, white
material resembling seashell, with most pieces
about the size of a grain of sand. The shellsnow
acts very much like real snow—the wind blows
it about, it is slippery and crunchy to walk on,
and so on—except it isn’t made of water (which
means the PCs can’t melt and drink it). There are no clouds, just a haze in some parts of the sky. This shellsnow doesn’t seem to be falling from
the sky except for the small amounts stirred up
by the wind.

> Because the PCs take
cold damage every ten
minutes, those with
low Might scores may
want to pause their
hike for a 1-action
recovery roll so the cold
doesn’t reduce them
to 0 Might and move
them one step down
on the damage track.

If the PCs spend at least ten minutes
examining, searching, or trying to salvage the
technological components in the walls, they can
attempt a level 6 task. If they fail, they realize
that anything that could have been taken is
already gone, and anything that remains is either
valueless or is so large and integrated into the
walls that it can’t be removed without rendering
it useless and valueless. If they succeed, they
find an oddity that previous looters overlooked:
a finger-sized piece of metal and glass that emits
a puff of air (about as strong as a person can
blow) when squeezed.

A PC skilled in crafting numenera, salvaging
numenera, or understanding numenera can tell
that there are a few sockets in the walls that look
like specific devices could be plugged into, but
what those items would do or how to activate
them is unknown.

Once the PCs are through with this area, they
need to decide where to go next. There’s nothing
noteworthy they can see to the north or south
along the face of the mountain. The upward
climb to the east seems difficult and dangerous.

If the PCs follow the downhill slope toward the
green valley, they should get there in about an
hour and a half (by sundown, assuming they
haven’t spent a lot of time in this area).

## 골짜기

As the PCs approach the green valley, they realize
the distortion they saw around it is a cloud of
shellsnow being churned into the air and slowly
rotating clockwise around the entire valley like a
storm. The shellsnow isn’t being moved by the
wind—intermittent gusts don’t have any effect
on the moving flakes, even if the wind is blowing
in the opposite direction of the flurries.

### 철탑

The perimeter of the valley has a series of
vertical, bronze-colored metal pylons, each as
thick as a wrist and almost 100 feet (30 m)
tall, topped with a glowing blue crystal and a
flattened metal ring floating above it. They are
spaced about 600 feet (180 m) apart. These
devices give off a faint noise sounding like a
voice constantly singing “aaaaahhhhhhhh,” and
are warm to the touch, like a dark-colored rock
on a sunny day. Very fine etchings on the surface
of the pylons might be writing or some kind of
circuitry, but are indecipherable to the PCs.

<div class="numenera-box">

### SALVAGING NUMENERA
Attempting to salvage an object or structure for valuable numenera requires a set of light tools
and takes anywhere from fifteen minutes to an hour. The difficulty of the task is equal to the level
of the item being salvaged (the structures in the Icon’s cave are level 5). Training in the salvaging
numenera skill eases this task, and having another PC (with another set of tools) helping the
salvaging PC can ease the task. The PC doing the salvaging must decide if they’re trying to get
cyphers, iotum, or shins, or if they are just trying to get whatever they can. Salvaging means the
PC is opening access panels, taking apart devices, and otherwise accessing the source’s interior.
Doing so provides a chance to find something of interest; refer to Salvage Success to determine
exactly what.
Salvage Success: If the salvaging task is a success, the PC gains something useful—cyphers,
iotum, shins, and so on. The description for each salvage location in the Icon’s cave explains
what the PCs get for a successful roll.
Parts: Parts are miscellaneous bits that can be reused (like screws, nuts, bolts, circuit boards,
and so on). Parts are tracked in units, and what kind of parts they are doesn’t really matter. Any
successful salvaging always gets the PC a number of units of parts equal to the level of the item
being salvaged.
Salvage Results: If the salvage attempt is successful, the PCs get something for their work.
Any later attempts to salvage that location are hindered by two steps.
If the initial salvage attempt fails, the item the PCs are attempting to salvage has nothing of
value, or the useful pieces are too difficult to remove without destroying them. Like any task the
PCs repeat after a failure, all later attempts require applying Effort.
Additional Salvage Attempts: Each time characters locate a potential source for salvage, a
subsequent attempt to search the same specific area again is hindered by one additional step.
Once a building in the Icon’s cave is salvaged, it can’t be salvaged again for numenera, although
a successful salvaging roll gets the PCs another 5 units of parts.
Salvaging Cyphers: Unused cyphers can be salvaged for shins, iotum, and parts. The difficulty
of the salvage roll is equal to the cypher’s level. Success means the cypher is destroyed and the
PC gains 1d10 shins, units of parts equal to the cypher’s level, and one roll on the random iotum
table

</div>
The valley pylons are powerful numenera
devices that maintain the valley’s temperature
and weather, and discourage large creatures
(such as [blacktusks](/ko/numenera/mini-bestiary#검은-엄니-black-tusk-4-12)) from entering the valley.
When necessary, they automatically create a
short-term force field dome to shelter the valley
from large threats like meteors, avalanches, and
high-velocity impacts (anything from a rocketpropelled missile to something minor like a
flying arrow), all of which are deflected off the
dome. The force field won’t activate in response
to slower objects (including thrown weapons
or a running creature). The pylons also prevent
most of the shellsnow from entering the valley,
and a side effect of this barrier causes the slow
clockwise “storm” of levitating flurries.
The pylons look like metallic bronze but are
made of a much stronger metal, and are essentially
invulnerable to any force the PCs can produce.
Attempting to damage or open a pylon results in a
small electrical shock that inflicts 2 points of Might
damage. The columns are very slightly flexible, and
a determined PC can shake one hard enough to
cause the top of the unit to sway a little bit, but
this doesn’t seem to interfere with its abilities and
doesn’t trigger the electrical shock.

This is a great time to introduce PCs to GM
intrusions. The affected PC gets 2 XP, one of
which the PC must give to a friend. Tell the
PCs they can spend the XP to improve their
characters if they use 4 XP, keep it to re-roll rolls
they are not happy with, or to refuse a future GM
intrusion.
Beyond the pylons, the air is clear, the foliage
is green, and the air is noticeably warmer but
still cool, like a brisk autumn day. The valley
is about 2 miles (3.2 km) across at its longest
axis and about half that distance wide. Trees
are plentiful and (for the most part) are planted
in rows. In the middle of these groves of trees,
near the center of the valley, is a tiny village with
two different kinds of buildings—bronze metal
domes and square stone cottages with sod roofs.
To the north, near the edge of the valley border, is
a huge bronze statue of a multi-armed humanoid
creature with a glowing blue crystal where its
face should be. There isn’t a road or path from
the PCs’ current position to the village, but from
here they can tell that there is such a thing closer
to the orchards.
### THE ORCHARDS
There are several kinds of trees around the
village, ranging from short to tall and pale green
to a dark olive color. Many of them produce fruit
(red, yellow, and blue, all of it safe and tasty for
humans) or nuts, and some have a loose kind of
bark that looks like it peels away from the trunk
in book-sized sheets. The PCs often see small
wooden ladders and step stools resting near or
against the taller trees.
Plump short-legged birds nest in the gaps
between roots or in small wooden houses with
removable roofs. The birds chase bugs, scratch
at the ground for worms, and generally ignore
the PCs (but casually strut away if anyone tries to
touch them).
A well-trod path leads toward the village, and
the closer they get to the village, the clearer it
and the paths between the trees become. This
is obviously a cultivated area that was set up by
intelligent creatures—presumably those in the
nearby village.
### WELCOMING PARTY
Unless the PCs chose to sneak into the orchards,
someone from the village spots them, and the
villagers send out a trio of people to meet them,
either in the orchard or at the border between the
trees and the village. If the PCs sneak into the
orchard and into the village itself, skip this initial
encounter and allow the PCs to decide when they
show themselves (strangers suddenly appearing
in their village is very alarming to the locals, and
all interactions with them will be hindered until
the PCs prove that they mean no harm).
The three villagers sent to meet the PCs are
cautious but curious. All three—two men and one
woman—are between 20 and 40 years old, dressed
in simple warm garments of woven fibers under
fur-lined capes. They adorn their clothing and hair
with bronze-metal bits and what appear to be
several kinds of brightly-colored seashells (the
people use these decorations for aesthetics and
currency, with each piece used as one shin). Each is
carrying a staff with a sharp curve on the end (like a
shepherd’s crook), a tool they use to pick fruit, as a
walking stick, and (if threatened) a weapon.
The villagers hail the PCs in an accented
version of the Truth and introduce themselves as
Ayil, Rieo, and Yoma from the village of Bardak.
They say they haven’t had a visitor to their part of
the world in a generation, and if the PCs promise
to cause no trouble, they are welcome to come
to the village for food, shelter, and warm clothes.
The villagers are neither hostile nor lying—their
invitation and motives are genuine. If asked,
they’ll answer basic questions about the village
(see the bullet point topics in the next section)

### THE VILLAGE OF BARDAK
The people of Bardak are happy to relate their
history to the PCs, which is only history as they
understand it, since the written records were
destroyed and they have only verbal stories that
have been repeated over the generations.
The village has twenty-five homes and a few
other buildings. Of these, six are metal domes
made of the same bronze-looking metal as the
pylons, and (like the pylons) they are basically
impervious to any attempts by the PCs to harm
them. Each dome has one door with a circular
pad that if touched opens or closes the door.
The remaining buildings are square and made
of mortared stone, with sod roofs. Each home
(regardless of its materials) houses several
generations of one family (married partners, their
children, and the children’s grandparents). Food
from the orchards is plentiful and the egg-birds
thrive in the temperate valley, so the people don’t
have to work too hard to survive, giving them a lot
of idle time for telling stories and praying. Their
greatest threat is inbreeding due to a small gene
pool, but it is not a serious risk yet, and in any case,
there is little they can do about that except ask their
rare visitors to join their village and start families.
The villagers don’t know where the founders came
from or where any other communities are nearby—
they have been isolated here a long, long time.
The Icon is the large statue to the north. The
villagers speak of it as if it were a sleeping
protector god, dangerous if woken unexpectedly,
but generally benign. They leave offerings of


<div class="numenera-box">

### BARDAK HISTORY
Bardak is a very tiny isolated village
with only about 100 people, all of them
descendants of a group of travelers who
were brought here about 200 years ago
by the numenera. The founders used the
numenera to create the pylons that keep
away the bad weather, build the metal
homes at the center of the village, plant the
orchards that fill the valley, and establish
the wards and rituals that keep the Icon
sleeping and happy. The numenera told
the founders to live here, watch over the
valley, and protect the Icon from those who
would wake or harm it, and that is what
they have done, passing on these traditions
to their children like it was a religion. They
understand (and are somewhat ashamed)
that their efforts and faith have not been
perfect, and as punishment in recent years
one of the pylons has stopped singing, and
from time to time dangerous creatures
have entered the valley.

</div>

food and carved wooden figurines at the base of
the path leading up to the Icon, but never step
past that point, as they believe the Icon is prone
to having nightmares and causes earthquakes
when it is startled or the religious rites are not
performed correctly. The Icon sleeps on top of a
doorway to the underworld, protecting the valley
from dangerous nano-spirits imprisoned there.
Nobody in the village alive today has gotten
close to the Icon or looked into the doorway—
doing so is forbidden by the Great Elders, and
the punishment is banishment from the village.
Forty years ago, a small group of strangers
came to the village, saying they came from a
place far away. They did not heed the elders’
warnings about the Icon and chose to look upon
the underworld with their own eyes. They were
never seen again, and shortly after they went
through the door, an earthquake shook the valley
and one of the southern pylons stopped singing.
The elders tell a story of another group of visitors
who came to the village long, long ago (before
the elders were even born), stayed for six days,
then decided to head west down the mountain
and were never seen again.
The villagers explain that Bardak is guided by
three Great Elders—people who are well over a
hundred years old, kept alive by blessings from
the numenera, and are very wise. Any decisions
that affect the entire tribe (such as religious

matters or inviting the PCs to stay more than a
couple of days) must have the input of all three
Great Elders. If the PCs want to discuss important
issues, or if they want to know more about
or investigate the Icon, some of the villagers
inform the Great Elders, who personally make an
appearance to talk with the PCs. Likewise, if the
PCs cause trouble, the Great Elders show up and
try to put a stop to it before any villagers get hurt.

### THE GREAT ELDERS
Augrom, Okeyay, and Thoak are the three Great
Elders of Bardak. Each of them reached old
age eighty to ninety years ago, but were able
to bond with one of three life crucibles—lifesustaining artifacts left behind by the founders.
The crucibles fused with their flesh, fortified
them against disease and poison, and have been
keeping them alive ever since. Each of the Great
Elders is now at least 140 years old, but their
crucibles keep them strong and healthy. Decades
of associating with each other, compounded
by their shared experience of forced evolution,
has made the three Great Elders very similar in
personality and temperament.
A life crucible is a levitating one-person
vehicle made of metal (the bronze-like stuff used
elsewhere in the village), shell-like growths, and
glass, looking much like a spherical chair that
can envelop an entire person (legs and all), with
a vertical metal pole extending out of the bottom
that doesn’t quite reach the ground. There
are two drawbacks to bonding with a crucible:
removing a person from the crucible is fatal, and
the crucible seems to be evolving or mutating
the elders into something other than human. The
Great Elders have swollen, distorted bodies and
faces, somewhat like a caterpillar, except instead
of transforming into a butterfly or moth, they
appear to be something in between the shape
of a human and a lobster, with carapace-like
growths on the chest and stomach, and several
pairs of little secondary limbs.
Like most of the numenera, humans have
adapted existing technology in ways that weren’t
intended. The crucibles weren’t designed to
keep humans alive, so the Great Elders’ physical
changes are probably a side effect of whatever
unknown function the crucibles were built to do.
The villagers are very respectful and
deferential toward the elders. Most of them
bow when an elder approaches, and many of
them unconsciously repeat certain things the
elders say, like they are responding to a sermon.
None of the villagers will go against the word
of an elder. The villagers do not understand the
technology that keeps the elders alive, or why it
has changed the elders’ bodies, but the elders
wisdom has kept the valley safe for a long time,
and that is reason enough to heed their words.
The Great Elders reiterate and clarify anything
the other villagers told the PCs. If the PCs seem
like people who would be useful to the survival
of the tribe, the Great Elders are likely to invite
them to settle down in the village.
The one thing the Great Elders are absolutely
insistent about is that nobody should go to
the Icon or enter the doorway at its base. This
was forbidden by the elders’ grandparents,
the founders of Bardak, who said that the Icon
watches over the valley in exchange for keeping
its sacred space untouched by mortal hands.
The Great Elders try different methods to deter
the PCs’ interest in that place—the underworld
nano-spirits beneath it will kill them, it has
powerful guardians to keep out trespassers,
there is a spirit creature that will eat the soul of
anyone who dares go there, interfering with the
Icon will destroy the wards placed on the valley,
the last people to try it were never seen again
and the valley had an earthquake the day they
tried, and so on. Of course, the PCs have heard
similar arguments from superstitious people
many times before, all of it rumors and lies to
keep people away from valuable and powerful
numenera…
## CONVINCING THE TRIBE
If the PCs want to leave, the villagers prepare
satchels with about three days worth of food
for each PC and give them each a warm cloak
to protect against the weather. A small group
of villagers gathers to watch the PCs leave, but
there is no ceremony or sentimentality to it.
If the PCs want permission to approach the
Icon, they need to convince two or more of the
Great Elders to vote in their favor. Because they
reinforce each others’ attitudes, these attempts
to persuade them must be done one at a time
when the other two Great Elders are not present.
Because the elders have been enforcing these
traditions for over a century, they are stuck in
their ways, and attempts to influence them are
hindered.
If all the PCs spend at least a day using their
skills and abilities to help the village (even
hard physical labor will do, although it is not
as impressive as some character abilities,
and takes a few days to “count for as much”
as a significant effort), the task to influence a
Great Elder is eased (which cancels out being
hindered).
The GM should let the players get creative
with how they might use their abilities to help the
village. If they can’t think of anything, feel free to
make the following suggestions:
• Gather Stone: Some of the homes are
crowded, and younger couples are planning
on building new cottages to give their
families room to grow. This requires a lot of
stone, and gathering enough for one cottage
takes about 30 person-hours worth of labor
(so 6 hours of five people working, 15 hours
of two people working, and so on).
• Build a Cottage: If there is enough stone on
hand, building the walls of a simple stone
cottage takes about 18 hours of hard labor
(usually spread out over three days instead
of all in one go). Every two people helping
reduces this time by about 3 hours.
• Meat and Hides: The valley provides all
the food the villagers need, but people still
have a taste for exotic foods, especially for
celebrations. Packs of [blacktusks](/ko/numenera/mini-bestiary#검은-엄니-black-tusk-4-12) sometimes
roam outside the pylons. Blacktusk fur is very
warm, and the villagers have a special recipe
for blacktusk steaks. The PCs would need to
track down the wandering predators (which
hunt in packs of three) or find a lair. One
dead blacktusk would be appreciated, and
two would be cause for a feast. The blacktusk
lair has one random cypher.
• Dangerous Interlopers: A cave near the
“quiet” southern pylon has become
overgrown with icy growths over the past
few days, resembling a castle. The elders say
the last time such a thing appeared near the
village it meant that dangerous creatures
called ice weavers had moved into the area,
and they soon started attacking the villagers.
The PCs could investigate this structure and
kill or drive away the ice weavers, but the
elders warn that the beasts can suck the heat
right out of a person’s body, and they travel
in packs. The ice weavers have two cyphers
embedded in the walls of their lair.

### PERMISSION TO EXPLORE
If the PCs convince the Great Elders to allow
them to visit the Icon, one of the elders insists
on cautiously seeing them off as they leave the
village. This is more of a show for the benefit of
the other villagers—depending on their attitude
toward the PCs, they might warn the villagers
that the foolish PCs are marching to their deaths
and that no wise people should ever do this, or
say that the PCs have the blessing of the elders
and are seeking new wisdom from the Icon, and
so on.
Award each PC 1 XP for convincing the Great
Elders to allow them to visit the Icon. Proceed
to the Approaching the Icon section of this
adventure.

### SNEAKING OUT
The PCs might try to sneak out of the village and
over to the Icon without anyone noticing them.
Fortunately, this is fairly easy to do, especially
if they have special abilities that conceal their
activities. If they fail, they are spotted, and the
elders and some villagers confront them in the
orchards—go to the Exploration Refused section.
If they succeed at sneaking out, proceed to the
Approaching the Icon section.

### EXPLORATION REFUSED
If the PCs fail to convince the elders to allow
them to explore the Icon, and are obvious in
their plans to explore it anyway, the elders have
the PCs watched, and when the PCs start to
make their way toward the Icon, the elders (and
ten villagers armed with staves) get in their path
as they pass through the orchards, insisting
that they leave the valley immediately. If the
PCs refuse to turn back, the elders and villagers
attack and attempt to subdue the PCs.
If the PCs lose this fight, they are tied up,
given warm cloaks and some food, taken outside
the western pylons, and told never to return to
the valley. Of course, even if they’re exiled this
way, there’s no reason the PCs can’t travel along
the pylons to the north and approach the Icon
from a different direction (the only drawback
to this is that once they’re outside the pylon
boundary, they’ll be out in the cold again and
taking damage every ten minutes, or every hour
if they wear the warm cloaks).
If the PCs defeat most of the villagers and
at least one of the elders, the remaining elders
call for a truce, stating that the PCs clearly
outmatch them and it is pointless to throw away
lives trying to stop them, at which point the
elders and villagers retreat into their homes and
barricade their doors in case the PCs unleash
some doom upon the valley.
If the PCs fought the villagers (regardless
of who wins), thereafter all interactions with
the villagers or the elders are hindered by
three steps, because the PCs are considered
dangerous, reckless, and disrespectful toward
the beliefs of the tribe.
Defeated villagers have 1d10 shins each.
A defeated elder’s crucible can be looted for
a random cypher: equal chances of a gravity
nullifier, Might rejuvenator, or warmth projector.
If the PCs chose not to kill the elder, the crucible
keeps them alive, but it can no longer levitate
(the villagers will have to build a mobility cart for
that elder).
### APPROACHING THE ICON
The path leading to the Icon winds back
and forth to the north, sometimes making a
switchback to reach a higher elevation. Along
the sides of the path are the remnants of old
offerings of food and wooden carvings from
villagers too afraid or too respectful to approach
any closer. Just before the path becomes jagged
and precarious is a small pile of flat stones, each
with a warning inscribed upon it in the Truth
to come no closer. The path near the stones is
covered in more offerings, most of which are at
least a week old. Beyond the stone markers, the
path continues along the top of a low ridge for
about a long distance, then smoothes out again
as it covers another zig-zagging long distance in
the final approach to the Icon itself. The statue is
near the pylon boundary, but at least a bowshot
away from the nearest pylon. Flurries of snow or
shellsnow blow about in the wind, and the air is
much colder at this altitude compared to the rest
of the valley.
The Icon is a roughly-humanoid metal statue
with a thin torso, broad shoulders, at least six
arms (with the lower pairs smaller than the
uppermost one), a glowing blue crystal where
its face should be, and long horizontal horns
jutting from the sides of its head. Its lower half
merges with a stone peak, making it hard to
tell if it has legs or some other alien body parts.
A vertical line of blue crystal extends from its

chest toward its midsection and downward to a
cave-like opening beneath it, all of which has the
same glow, pulsing in a downward pattern like
a river of light trickling from the statue’s face.
From the path approaching its base to the top of
its angular head, it is easily 40 feet (12 m) tall. At
this distance, it is easy to see that the Icon was
probably made by the same beings who built the
pylons. It is made of the same bronze-like metal,
has similar blue crystals, and features several
levitating metal rings. There is a sensation of
powerful energy in the air, and the Icon is faintly
making the same singing sound as the pylons.
The path leads into the glowing cave at
the base of the Icon. There are no paths or
handholds to indicate there is an easy way to
climb onto the statue itself. Climbing onto the
Icon is a difficulty 4 task. Touching the Icon
triggers its defenses, and anyone touching it
must make a level 8 Might defense roll or take 1
point of electricity damage (this damage ignores
armor). This repeats each round someone is
still touching it, with the damage increasing by
1 point each time. The electrical defense stops if
nobody touches the Icon for a full minute. When
inspected at a close distance, it is apparent that
there are no doors, hatches, panels, or other
mechanisms on the surface of the Icon; even the
glowing crystals appear to be seamlessly fused
with the metal. The only way in is the groundlevel cave entrance.

## BENEATH THE ICON

The cave entrance is about 15 feet (4.5 m) high
and diamond-shaped in cross section. The
blue crystal from the Icon extends to the cave
entrance and along the ceiling, illuminating the
area with a glow nearly as bright as daylight.
The floor of the cave has been carved (with
remarkable precision) into a smooth set of stairs
leading downward. A small amount of shellsnow,
dirt, and other debris has accumulated in the
corners of the stairs, but otherwise it looks
like no people have been here in quite a while.
The blue ceiling light becomes less intense the
deeper the stairs go.
One round after anything about the size of a
human steps through the doorway, the ceiling
light begins to quickly strobe in an irregular
pattern. Anyone within a short distance of the
entrance who can see the light must make an
Intellect defense roll (level 8) or become stunned
for one round, losing their action. This flashing
repeats once per minute as long as someone is
within a short distance of the entryway

> The PCs don’t have to salvage these three devices in the adventure (they can opt to salvage them as cyphers and shins instead of fully-functional machines), but not doing so means they won’t be able to teleport home, and will have to leave the village on foot and figure out where in the world they are. Numenera is all about discovery and exploration!

### THE ICON’S CAVE
The stairs continue downward a short distance
and open up into a larger cave (with the PCs
arriving at the south end), the floor of which
is covered in a lumpy layer of shellsnow and
spattered with waste from harmless ceilingdwelling flying animals. The cave is roughly
circular and about a long distance in diameter.
The ceiling light ends just past the stairs, giving
off enough light to reveal seven bronze-metal
buildings built inside the cave. The buildings
are all approximately the same size. One of the
domes doesn’t have a door, but all the others
have a metal door with a large circular pad on it,
just like the dome houses in Bardak.
The dome exteriors are level 8, but the
numenera and walls on the inside are only level
5. The doors automatically shut one minute after
they are opened (the inner side of the door has a
touchpad like the outside).

### FLYING DEFENDERS
When the PCs first leave the steps and enter the
cave, ten gazers fly out of concealed niches and
create a spherical formation about half as tall as
a human. They pivot their red beam-generating
crystals toward the closest PC and blink warningly.
This is an attempt at deterrence rather than a
prelude to a surprise attack. If the PCs move
farther into the cave, or act like they’re going to
attack the gazers, the machines shoot first, acting
as two level 3 swarms. If the PCs retreat up the
stairs, the gazers stop attacking and do not follow,
but if the PCs return, the gazers recognize them
by sight and resume their attack.

### RECYCLING TECHNOLOGY
The PCs don’t know it yet, but by carefully
salvaging numenera from these structures,
they can gather iotum and devices that, if
connected to the high-altitude dome the PCs
arrived in at the start of this adventure, can be
used to teleport them back to the part of the
world they’re from. If the PCs attempt to salvage
anything from any of the domes here, they
realize that the physical connectors between
devices (sockets, plugs, and so on) match those
they saw in the arrival dome, and they might be

able to use numenera from this cave to repair
or build a functional teleporter there and send
themselves home.
The items the PCs need are a navigational
system from area 1, a power battery from
area 2, a dimensional interface from area 3,
and 3 io and 1 bio-circuitry. Those items, plus
some miscellaneous parts and know-how,
when plugged into the proper ports in the
arrival dome, allow the PCs to make a one-use
teleportation device that should send them back
to where they came from.

### INCONVENIENT WORM ENCOUNTER
A swarm of twelve chaliks lives in this cave,
feeding on ceiling-flyers and whatever else
stumbles into this area. These big insects
can propel themselves across or through the
shellsnow like they are swimming or burrowing,
leaving odd wandering trails everywhere in this
area. As the PCs move around in the cave and
make noise, they’ll hear an unsettling scratching
and scrabbling noise as the chaliks circle around
and assess their prey. The chaliks prefer to
attack an isolated PC (perhaps one standing
guard outside a dome while the others search or
salvage), or make their move at an inopportune
time for the PCs, such as while they are resting
or sleeping. When the chaliks decide to attack,
they approach by burrowing under the layer of
shellsnow, hindering by two steps any chances to
notice them approaching.

### 1. NAVIGATION
This dome is located in the southeast part of the
cave. When its door is opened, small blue lights
activate in the interior, and a blue hologramlike screen appears with diagrams and strange
writing. A successful understanding numenera
roll takes ten minutes and means the PC thinks
this device is some sort of mapping tool, or a
tracking system, or a navigational aid, but none
of the details or landmarks are anything they
recognize (or even seem to be related to points
on Earth that the PCs are familiar with).
Salvage: With a successful salvaging roll, the
PCs can acquire a functional navigational device,
a random cypher, 1d2 responsive synth and 3
io, and 1d10 shins. The navigational device is
about the size of a briefcase and looks like a
series of bronze-metal spheres and thin pipes,
each with needle-like projections sticking in
many directions. If they don’t care about keeping
the navigational device functional, they can
disassemble it for another random cypher.

### 2. GEOTHERMAL POWER
This dome is larger than the other by half and
is located on the northwest part of the cave.
The air around this dome is noticeably warmer
than the rest of the cave, comparable to holding
your hand near a lit torch. Touching the dome
or the door inflicts 1 point of damage from heat
(this damage ignores armor). Using a tool (even
something like a knife) to touch the pad opens
the door without inflicting any damage. The air
inside the dome is hot like a sauna and pours
out into the main room as long as the door is
open. The heat is uncomfortable enough that a
human inside this building takes 1 point of heat
damage every ten minutes they spend there.
The far half of the room is filled with hundreds
of vertical metal pipes topped with flat or round
caps. The near half of the room is open, and a blue
hologram-like screen appears with diagrams and
strange writing. The pipes sometimes make gurgling
noises like liquid is moving around in them.

A PC skilled in understanding numenera
can successfully interact with the hologram
by experimenting with it for ten minutes and
making a level 5 understanding numenera roll.
Once this connection is made, the PCs can
spend another ten minutes to access some of
the information stored here, which seems to be
about regulating and channeling a power source
deep underground
One holographic diagram vaguely resembles
a topographical map of the valley, with about 50
symbols representing the pylons marked on the
map. One pylon on the south end of the valley
has a very different symbol than the others;
the PCs’ understanding of what the symbols
mean is very rudimentary, but given that the
villagers and elders spoke of a southern pylon
that “stopped singing,” it’s a reasonable bet
to think that this unique symbol indicates the
pylon isn’t functioning. A PC who understands
the holographic interface can spend ten minutes
trying to reroute power to the nonfunctional
pylon. If they make a level 5 understanding
numenera roll, they are successful, and the
symbol changes to match that of the other
pylons. (They could use a similar technique to
turn off an active pylon.)
If the PCs have salvaged the navigation dome
(area 1) or the dimensional interface dome (area
4), they might briefly see a holographic warning
image here showing a dome with a flashing
diagram of the missing device or devices (which
they recognize as the object they claimed or
disassembled from that dome).
Salvage: The systems controlled in this dome
are delicately connected to the functioning of
the pylons, and reckless salvage here means
about one-third of the pylons shut down. With
a successful salvaging roll, the PCs can acquire
a functional power battery and 1d10 shins; they
also recognize there are two other devices here
that they could remove and use as cyphers, but
trying to loosen them triggers warnings on the
holographic interface. If the PCs stop salvaging
those two devices and push them back into
place, the warnings stop. If the PCs decide to loot
those two cyphers anyway, 20 of the pylons shut
down. The PCs can reactivate five of those pylons
by using the holographic interface to reroute
power (a level 5 understanding numenera task),
but the loss of so many active pylons greatly
reduces the system’s ability to protect the valley,
with dangerous long-term consequences for the
villagers. Reattaching a removed device is a level 5
crafting numenera task; if both are reattached, the
pylons regain power after 1d10 minutes.
The salvaged power battery is a squared-off
cylinder the length of a human forearm, with
rows of blue crystal lights along the length,
apertures at both ends, and a tendency to heat
up for a few seconds before returning to room
temperature again. If the PCs don’t care about
keeping the power battery functional, they can
disassemble it for 1d2 responsive synth and 5 io
and a random cypher.

### 3. HISTORICAL ARCHIVE
This dome is slightly smaller than the others and
is located in the southwest part of the cave, near
the wall. Its doorway is open and there doesn’t
seem to be a door built into it. The shellsnow
covers the floor inside just like it does in the
cave, except there are no animals living here, so
all of it is uniformly pale off-white. There are no
grooves in the shellsnow (a device built into this
structure keeps animals away despite having an
open door) and its surface is smooth (whatever
human tracks might have been here have been
erased by a thousand years of earthquakes in this
region).
As soon as anyone enters the room, subtle
blue crystal lights come to life on the inner
surface of the dome, shining dozens of harmless
laser-like beams into the room, forming relaxing
wavelike patterns. If someone sits or stands in
the center of the room and makes large gestures
that interrupt the beams, the crystals adjust in
response to the PC’s movements. If someone
can create the proper activation gestures
(requiring several minutes and a successful level
5 understanding numenera roll), a telepathic
sequence begins playing into the minds of
anyone in the dome.
The message feels like a memory, but is clearly
not something the PCs personally experienced,
and the narrative is weird and disjointed.

*Huge pale animals resembling hard-shelled sea creatures, harnessed with bands and implants of bronze. A sea of black spots against a red background, whorled with umber. A sensation of time passing. A blue sphere appearing in the red. Pain. Cold. The great sea creatures struggling against an invisible weight. They die. Smaller sea creatures dismantle their metal and flesh, leaving tiny fragments everywhere. A blue light in darkness. Bronze domes scattered like pebbles. Time. Weariness. Sleep.*

The PCs can repeat this message as often
as they want, and some details change slightly
each time it is played, but the overall story is
basically the same. They can’t make this building
do anything else. If nobody is in the Historical
Archive for ten minutes or more, the beams stop
and the crystal lights go dark.
Salvage: There is no numenera in this dome
that is essential to the functioning of the Icon
or the pylons, so the PCs can salvage things to
their hearts’ content without worrying about
endangering the villagers. With a successful
salvaging roll, the PCs can acquire a random
cypher and 1d10 shins.

### 4. DIMENSIONAL FIELD REGULATOR
This dome is located near the center of the cave,
and is surrounded by several clusters of vertical
bronze-metal pipes, similar to the valley pylons,
but only twice as tall as a human. When the
door to this dome opens, the first thing the PCs
notice is a human figure on the floor, dressed in
explorer’s clothing, its flesh withered away in the
dry air so that it almost looks mummified.
A few seconds after the door opens, a
holographic interface appears in the air, gently
illuminating the interior of the dome and
revealing that one of the wall panels has been
pried open, revealing some of the numenera
built into the dome. There is no obvious cause
of death for the dead explorer (no wounds or
obvious trauma), but the body has been here so
many years that something subtle might have
killed this person and the signs of it faded over
the years. The body has a set of small tools and
several knives.

Interacting with the holographic interface takes
ten minutes and a successful understanding
numenera roll. The machines appear to create,
contain, and adjust exotic energy fields that
resonate at different frequencies. Each of those
frequencies corresponds to one entry in a long
list, but what those entries mean is something
the PCs can’t decipher.
Salvage: The systems controlled in this dome
help regulate the functions built into the pylons,
and careless salvage here means the pylons
become much less effective at protecting the
valley. With a successful salvaging roll, the PCs
can acquire a functional dimensional interface
and 1d10 shins; they also recognize that there
is another device they could remove and use
as a cypher, but loosening it creates a weird
spinning sensation in the cave and causes a
minor earthquake. If the PCs decide to loot the
cypher anyway, the hologram shows several
alarm symbols over a map of the pylons, and the
pylons can no longer deflect attacks or creatures
(they can only mitigate the weather in the valley).
Reattaching the removed cypher is a level 5
crafting numenera task; success means the
pylons start working normally again.
The salvaged dimensional interface is a blue
crystal about the size of a human head, with
blinking blue lights swirling around inside it and
multiple incomplete metal shells surrounding
it like layers of an onion. There is a complex
aperture at one end, and the whole thing feels
almost weightless, like a balloon. If the PCs don’t
care about keeping the dimensional interface
functional, they can disassemble it for 1d2 pliable
metal and 2 io and a random cypher.

### ADDITIONAL DOMES
The other domes in this cave are left for the GM
to expand this area with additional encounters
for an ongoing campaign. (For an even larger
expansion, one of them could have a ramp or
elevator to a lower level that opens onto an even
larger cave with more domes and other devices.)
If you’re using this adventure as a one-shot or
introduction to Numenera and you don’t want
to add additional material here, their doors are
sealed and cannot be opened by the PCs—the
touch-pad doesn’t respond to any activity, or
perhaps it makes curt noises or flashes a light to
indicate an unauthorized attempt.

## BACK TO THE VILLAGE
Once the PCs have taken what they want from
the Icon’s cave, they can return to the village
of Bardak, or skip interacting with the villagers
again and move on to their next destination
(whether that is down the mountain, up to the
arrival dome, or elsewhere).
Award each PC 1 XP for exploring and salvaging
the ancient structures underneath the Icon. If they
salvaged all three items they need to rebuild the
teleporter, give each PC an additional 1 XP.

### PYLON ACTIVATED
If the PCs return to the village and they have
reactivated the unpowered pylon, the whole
village knows about it. (Even if the PCs caused an
earthquake, if all the pylons are fully functional,
the villagers accept this as a necessary
consequence of fixing the problem.) The villagers
speak many prayers and blessings for the PCs,
thanking them for helping protect their village
and valley, and insisting they stay a few days to
enjoy a celebratory feast in their honor. Even the
Great Elders are impressed and praise the PCs
(although because of their somewhat-inhuman
features it is difficult to tell how they really feel
about the situation).
The feast takes place at sundown around a
large bonfire, with all the villagers singing and
dancing some of their traditional songs and
reciting the names of the PCs as part of the
lyrics. A large amount of food is served, as well
as a small amount of fruit wine. One of the
elders formally invites the PCs to live in Bardak,
for their actions have proven that they are true
guardians of the Icon, worthy additions to the
tribe, and blessed by the spirits of the founders.
The elder also says that they understand if the
heroes must leave, for there are other villages
and holy sites of the Icon that might need their
help (this is half the elder trying to make the
villagers accept that the PCs may need to leave,
and half the elder hoping that these annoying
visitors get the hint that they are a disruption to
the status quo and should go).

### PYLON TROUBLES
If the PCs return to the village and they have
deactivated or otherwise hampered the functions
of the pylons (and especially if there was an
earthquake), the villagers can already tell that
something is amiss, are worried about the future
of the valley and their duties, and are angry at
the PCs for bringing harm to the village. If the
PCs aren’t very, very careful, the villagers form
a mob and attack the PCs, pelting them with
fruit, pushing them out of Bardak, and shouting
at them to never return. Individually or in small
numbers, the villagers are not a threat, but
all sixty or so healthy adult villagers working
together can overwhelm the PCs, functioning
as four level 4 mobs, which doesn’t include the
Great Elders attacking.

### TIME TO WALK AWAY
If the PCs leave Bardak as heroes, the entire
village gathers to see them off. The elders speak
a blessing for them, the villagers give them
food and warm clothing (if they haven’t done so
already), and one villager (if the PCs befriended
any villagers, it should be one of those) presents
them with a carved wooden box containing 50
shins—all donated by the adult villagers as
a thank-you for their holy efforts to serve the
Icon. The PCs can then head out into the world,
looking for more wonders to discover and a
way to get back to the part of the world they’re
familiar with.
If the villagers are now hostile to the PCs or
the PCs otherwise want to slip away unnoticed,
there is no fanfare as they depart. At best, a few
villagers and one elder watch to make sure they
leave. At worst, some villagers may shout insults
at the PCs as they leave, though none curse,
threaten, or attack them as they go. In any case,
the PCs can make their way down the mountain
in search of civilization, travel north or south
along the cold mountain for other places to
explore, or even crest the ridge to the east and
see what lies beyond.

### REBUILDING THE TELEPORTER
This ending is similar to the previous one
(including the farewell reactions of the villagers),
except instead of heading downhill toward the
flat land, the PCs climb back toward the arrival
dome.
To connect the devices they salvaged from
the Icon’s cave to the arrival building, the PCs
must use the crafting numenera skill to plug all
the pieces together in the right way and the right
order. This requires six crafting numenera rolls,
each of which takes an hour. The first roll is level
1, the second is level 2, and so on, all the way up
to level 6 for the final roll. If the crafting PC fails
a roll, they can try again (a failed roll costs them
an hour of time, and they have to use Effort on
the reroll) . The GM should keep track of how
many failures are rolled as part of this process (it
has an impact on the PCs later). Because some
of the last rolls are very difficult, the PCs might
want to apply Effort to them to make the task
easier and prevent multiple failures in a row.
Another character trained in the crafting
numenera skill can help the PC doing the repairs.
This eases the difficulty by two steps—one
for helping, one for being trained in the skill.
A character with an inability in the crafting
numenera skill, or no training in it at all, can’t
help with these tasks.
If none of the PCs have the crafting numenera
skill, they can try repairing the teleporter using
the understanding numenera skill, but the
difficulty of all the rolls are hindered.
Once the PCs have everything plugged in,
they can tell that the pieces are drawing power
and everything should work. However, the
whole thing is a kit-bashed mess of different
parts, and odds are it’ll work only once—like
the teleportation to this place at the start of
the adventure, this is a one-way trip. When
they activate the teleporter, a familiar chain of
events begins, all taking place in a matter of
seconds: a force field bubble appears, preventing
anything from moving in or out of the area.
Weird lights flash. A deep vibration begins and
increases in intensity. Some of the patchedtogether connections start to melt, and one
part of the device shudders and starts emitting
smoke. Finally, there is a bright flash and the
teleportation occurs.
What exactly happens to the PCs depends
on how successful they were at crafting this
improvised teleporter. If they failed no crafting
rolls, everything works fine and everyone arrives
perfectly healthy. If they failed one crafting roll,
a minor secondary effect happens when they
activate the teleporter. If they failed two crafting
rolls, there is a major secondary effect. If they
failed three or more crafting rolls, there is a
minor secondary effect, a major secondary effect,
and the PCs end up off-target (landing wherever
in the Ninth World the GM wants the next
session to take place). If there is a secondary
effect, roll on the following table or tables to see
what happens.

## 무작위 사이퍼
The PCs have several opportunities to acquire new cyphers in this adventure. Choose cyphers from
this list or roll randomly to determine what the PCs get.
1 Density Nodule: A level 3 yellow crystal surrounded by thick metal wires. When attached
to a weapon, for the next 28 hours it increases the weapon’s density at the instant of
impact, increasing its damage by 2 points.
2 Electricity Detonation: A level 4 metal disc with multiple blue crystals. It explodes in an
immediate radius, inflicting electrical damage equal to the cypher’s level. You can throw it
up to a short distance.
3 Emotion Poison Injector: A level 4 synth syringe-like device with no needle. A person
injected with it feels happy for one hour, easing all interaction tasks to affect them while it
lasts.
4 Force Cube Projector: A level 3 segmented synth cube with a faint green glow coming
from the gaps between the segments. It creates an immobile cube composed of six walls
of solid force centered on you, each 30 feet (9.1 m) to a side, for one hour. The walls
conform to the space available.
5 Gravity Nullifier: A level 5 belt attachment. It lets the user float into the air for one hour,
moving vertically up to a short distance per round. This doesn’t allow the user to move
horizontally (but they can push away from a wall or use other methods to go sideways).
The user must weigh less than 50 pounds (22 kg) per cypher level.
6 Instant Shelter: A level 2 cylindrical lattice made of synth. It absorbs water and air to
create a simple cubical building 10 feet (3 m) on a side with a door and window. It is
made of hard foam and is permanent and immobile once created.
7 Magnetic Attack Drill: A level 5 small sphere with a screw-like protrusion. If thrown at
an opponent, it drills into them and inflicts damage equal to the cypher’s level. If the
opponent is metal or wearing metal, the attack roll is eased.
8 Might Rejuvenator: A level 6 handheld apparatus. It injects one creature with chemicals
that restore a number of points equal to the cypher’s level to the creature’s Might pool.
9 Ray Emitter: A level 5 synth headband with metal knobs. The wearer can create a ray of
energy that strikes a target up to a long distance away and inflicts heat damage equal to
the cypher’s level.
10 Warmth Projector: A level 3 metal container filled with nanofluid. When the fluid is
touched to the user’s skin, it forms an articulated carapace-like protective barrier for 28
hours that provides Armor equal to the cypher’s level against cold damage.

누메네라는 머나먼 미래를 무대로, 전통적인 판타지에 새로운 감각을 더해 RPG의 상상력에 다시 활기를 불어 넣은 작품입니다. 플레이어 캐릭터들은 수수께끼와 위험이 가득찬 세계에서 과거의 유산들을 발견합니다. 보이지 않는 나노테크, 아직도 궤도를 도는 위성들이 자아내는 데이터스피어, 생명공학으로 만들어진 생물들, 이해 불가능한 원리로 움직이는 온갖 기이하고 신비로운 장치들입니다.

누메네라는 RPG계에서 손꼽히는 거장 몬티 쿡의 작품입니다. 정제되고 직관적인 구조로 몇 분이면 캐릭터를 만들 수 있고, 까다로운 룰보다 이야기에 집중하는 것이 특징입니다.

악마의 등뼈는 네 편의 독특한 시나리오를 극적으로 이은 연작 시나리오입니다. 악마의 등뼈가 붙은 사람에게 남은 시간은 얼마 없습니다. 그것을 제거하기 위해, 주인공들은 잊혀진 고대의 기계 왕릉으로, 바이러스의 부름 속으로, 그리고 코어북의 지도 저편에 있는 소용돌이치는 바다로 떠납니다.

이 세 편의 시나리오는 아무 순서로나 플레이해서 미니 캠페인으로 쓸 수도 있고, 틀이 되는 시나리오인 고귀한 과업을 무시하고 각각 독자적으로 사용할 수도 있습니다. 악마의 등뼈를 통해, 팀은 누메네라의 환상적인 설정과 흥미로운 이야기 구조를 맛보게 될 것입니다.

누메네라2는 디스커버리와 데스티니, 두 권의 책으로 이루어져 있습니다.

누메네라 디스커버리는 기존 코어북의 내용을 토대로 새로운 3편의 시나리오와 개정된 룰, 내용을 담고 있습니다.

누메네라 데스티니는 완전히 새로운 유형의 캐릭터 아르쿠스, 델브, 라이트를 비롯해 밝은 미래를 만들어가기 위해 누메네라 탐색(salvaging)과 아이오툼을 이용한 누메네라 제작, 커뮤니티를 만들어 갈 수 있는 새로운 규칙과 조언, 시나리오들이 실려 있습니다.

한국에는 아직 번역되지 않았지만, 누메네라를 더 많은 분들이 구매하고 즐겨주신다면 정발될 수 있지 않을까 싶습니다. (역자의 개인적인 바람입니다.) 영어판은 위 이미지를 클릭하시면 몬티 쿡 게임즈의 스토어에서 구매하실 수 있습니다.

이 퀵스타트 [바다의 재] 역시 누메네라 2에 기반하고 있습니다. 누메네라2는 기존 누메네라 코어북의 컨텐츠와 완전히 호환됩니다. 개정된 갑옷 규칙이나, 플레이어 개입, 캐릭터 아크에 대해서는 공개된 사이퍼 SRD의 내용을 참고하셔도 좋습니다.

## CHARACTER DESCRIPTOR, TYPE, AND FOCUS
Each character has a simple statement that describes them, like: “I am a [adjective here] [noun here] who [verb here].” For example, Naveed is a Heroic Glaive who Thunders and Lobin is a Clever Nano who Focuses Mind Over Matter. In this sentence, the adjective is called your descriptor.

The noun is your character type.

The verb is called your focus.

In some games, character type might be called your character class. It’s the noun of the sentence “I am an adjective noun who verbs.” You can choose from six character types: Arkus, Delve, Glaive, Jack, Nano, and Wright.

Your descriptor places your character in the situation and helps provide motivation. It’s the adjective of the sentence “I am an adjective noun who verbs.”

Focus is what your character does best. It’s the verb of the sentence “I am an adjective noun who verbs.”

## CHARACTER STATS
Every character has three defining characteristics, called “statistics” or “stats.” Might, Speed, and Intellect.

Might: The concepts of strength, endurance, constitution, hardiness, and physical prowess are all folded into Might. Might governs actions from forcing doors open to resisting disease. It’s also the primary means of determining how much damage your character can sustain. Characters interested in fighting focus on Might.

Speed: Speed embodies quickness, movement, dexterity, and reflexes. Speed governs dodging attacks, sneaking around, or throwing a ball accurately. Nimble, fast, or sneaky characters have good Speed stats.

Intellect: Intellect encompasses intelligence, wisdom, charisma, education, reasoning, wit, willpower, and charm. Intellect governs solving puzzles, remembering facts, telling convincing lies, and using mental powers. Characters good at communicating effectively or wielding the numenera stress their Intellect stat.

## POOL, EDGE, AND EFFORT
Each of these stats has two components: Pool and Edge. Your Pool is raw ability, and your Edge represents knowing how to use what you have. A third element ties into this concept: Effort. When your character really needs to accomplish a task, apply Effort.

### POOL
A Pool is the most basic measurement of a stat.
Comparing the Pools of two creatures gives a
general sense of which is superior. For example,
Naveed has a Might Pool of 16, and thus is
stronger than Chaury, who has a Might Pool of
12. Most average characters have a Pool of 9 to
12 in most stats.
When your character is injured, sickened,
or attacked, you temporarily lose points from
one of your stat Pools. The nature of the attack
determines which Pool loses points. Physical
damage from a sword reduces your Might Pool,
a poison that makes you clumsy reduces your
Speed Pool, and a psionic blast reduces your
Intellect Pool. You can rest to regain lost points
from a stat Pool (see Recovering Points in a
Pool, page 28).

### EDGE
Pool is the basic measurement of a stat, but
Edge is also important. When something
requires you to spend points from a stat Pool,
Edge reduces the cost. It also reduces the cost of
applying Effort to a roll.
For example, Lobin wants to use the
Onslaught ability, which costs 1 point from his
Intellect Pool. Subtract his 1 Intellect Edge from
the activation cost, and the result is how many
points he must spend. Since the result is 0, the
ability is free.

### EFFORT
When your character really needs to accomplish
a task, apply Effort. Applying Effort requires
spending 3 points from the stat Pool appropriate
to the action. Thus, if your character tries to
dodge (a Speed roll) and wants to increase
the chance for success, you can apply Effort by
spending 3 points from your Speed Pool. The
game master determines the difficulty of the task
(1 to 10). Effort lowers the difficulty of the task by
one step. This is called easing the difficulty. So,
if the difficulty is 5, using Effort makes it 4. This
must be done before you attempt a roll.
Every character has an Effort score, which
indicates the maximum number of levels of
Effort that can be applied.
When you apply Effort, subtract your relevant
Edge from the total cost of applying Effort. For
example, let’s say you need to make a Speed roll.
You apply one level of Effort, which will ease the
task by one step. Normally, that would cost 3 points
from your Speed Pool. However, you have a Speed
Edge of 1, so you subtract that from the cost. So, it
only costs 2 points from your Speed Pool.
Skills, equipment and special abilities can
ease a task and can be used in conjunction with
Effort.

### EFFORT AND DAMAGE
Instead of applying Effort to ease your attack,
you can apply Effort to increase the amount of
damage you inflict for any kind of attack. For
each level of Effort, you inflict 3 additional points
of damage.
When using Effort to increase the damage of
an area attack, such as the explosion created by a
detonation cypher, you inflict 2 additional points
of damage instead of 3 points. But those points
are dealt to all targets in the area. Even if one or
more of the targets in the area resists, you still
inflict 1 point of damage to them.

## SKILLS (AND INABILITIES)
Your character has training in a handful of specific
skills. For example, you might be trained in sneaking,
climbing and jumping, or social interactions. A
character’s level of skill is either trained (reasonably
skilled) or specialized (very skilled).
If you are trained in a skill relating to a task,
ease that task by one step. If you are specialized,
ease it by two steps. A skill can never ease a task
by more than two steps, but you can use a skill
and Effort together.
You can always attempt any action—you do
not need a related skill. In other words, having
training in climbing doesn’t let you climb, it just
makes you good at it. Anyone can still try to climb.
Some characters have inabilities. If a character
has an inability in a task, the difficulty of that task
is one step more difficult for that character. This
is called hindering a task.

## SPECIAL ABILITIES
Character types and foci grant PCs special
abilities. Using these abilities usually
costs points from your stat Pools (listed in
parentheses after the ability name). Your Edge
in the appropriate stat can reduce the cost, but
you can only apply Edge once per action. For
example, let’s say a Nano with an Intellect Edge
of 2 wants to use their Onslaught ability, which
costs 1 Intellect point. They also want to increase
the damage by using a level of Effort, which costs
3 Intellect points. The total cost for the action is
2 points from their Intellect Pool (1 point for the
Onslaught plus 3 points for using Effort minus 2
points from their Edge).
Sometimes the point cost for an ability has
a + sign after the number. That means you can
spend more points or more levels of Effort to
improve the ability.
Many special abilities grant a character the
option of performing an action that they couldn’t
normally do, such as projecting rays of cold or
attacking multiple foes at once. Using one of these
abilities is an action unto itself, and the end of the
ability’s description says “Action” to remind you.
Some special abilities allow you to perform a
familiar action—one that you can already do—in
a different way. For example, an ability might
let you wear heavy armor or add 2 points of fire
damage to your weapon damage. These are
called enablers. Using one of these abilities is not
considered an action. Enablers either function
constantly (such as being able to wear heavy
armor) or happen as part of another action (such
as adding fire damage to your weapon damage,
which happens as part of your attack). If a special
ability is an enabler, the end of the ability’s
description says “Enabler” to remind you.

## CYPHERS AND ODDITIES
Cyphers are a type of numenera that have a
single use. They might allow you to fly or become
temporarily invisible. You can’t bear many
cyphers at a time because these weird items
emit radiation or dangerous chemicals that don’t
mix well. Thus, each character has a cypher limit
indicating how many cyphers they can carry.
You can use your cyphers to activate their
abilities as your action, just as you would a
special ability. The only difference is, once you’ve
used a cypher, it’s gone.
Characters will find new cyphers frequently
during the game, so players shouldn’t hesitate to
use their cypher abilities.
Oddities are numenera devices that don’t have
much (apparent) practical purpose. They aren’t
weapons or tools or wondrous things that grant
powers. But they at least have some barter value
if you need to do some trading.

## ARTIFACTS
Artifacts are technological devices like cyphers,
but you can use them more than once. They
also have a rate of power depletion, like “1 in
1d10.” When an artifact is used or activated,
the player rolls the designated die (1d6, 1d10,
1d20, or 1d100). If the die shows the depletion
number(s), the item works, but that is its last
use. A depletion entry of “—” means that
the artifact never depletes, and an entry of
“automatic” means that it can be used only
once.

## EQUIPMENT AND SHINS
Each character has normal equipment they can
use, including backpacks, ropes, torches, and so
on. In the Ninth World, a few special items are
considered equipment as well. These include
glowglobes and even stranger things, but if need
be, such things are explained on your character
sheet.
Shins are currency in the Ninth World—or
the closest thing they have to currency. Shins
represent a common unit of barter. When coins
are needed, shins take the form of various
bits and parts of numenera devices, usually
scavenged from large machines—buttons, gears,
or diodes.
A shin is enough to buy a hefty drink or a light
meal. It will get you a bed to sleep in for a night,
or allow you to buy a small, simple object like a
knife.
